0,James Francis,Jan 3,"The industry? No. The livelihoods of many artists? Yes, it will. Let me take you back to the late 1800s. More organised and industrial methods allowed companies to produce art objects at scale. It became a lot cheaper to afford something like a chair or vase, because these objects were made in primitive assembly lines (the renowned sculptor Ronin cut his teeth making thousands of miniature statues for one of these shops). The upside was that art became a lot more affordable. The downside is that the quality also suffered and artisan artists were starting to lose work. Enter William Morris and his… (more)",5
