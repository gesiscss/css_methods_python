    "# Session 6: Natural Language Processing\n",
    "The field of study that focuses on the interactions between human language and computers is called natural language processing (NLP).\n",
    "\n",
    "NLP is a field of artificial intelligence in which computers analyze, understand, and derive meaning from human language in a smart and useful way. NLP systems are used exploiting the signals in our language used to predict all of the aforementioned features: people’s age (Nguyen et al., 2011; Rosenthal & McKeown, 2011), gender (Alowibdi et al., 2013; Ciot et al., 2013; Liu & Ruths, 2013), personality (Park et al., 2015), job title (Preoţiuc-Pietro et al., 2015a), income (Preoţiuc-Pietro et al., 2015b), and much more (Volkova et al., 2014, 2015).\n",
    "\n",
    "In NLP, word embeddings have been at the forefront of this progress, which has expanded to include flexible model architectures (Hovy, 2021). The most publicly visible example of this shift is probably the translation quality of services like Google Translate (Wu et al., 2016).\n",
    "\n",
    "A collection of fundamental tasks appear frequently across various NLP projects (Vajjala et al., 2020). Let’s briefly introduce them (Figure 1):\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='images/nlp_tasks.png' style='height: 400px; float: right'>\n",
    "\n",
    "*Language modeling* is the task of predicting what the next word in a sentence will be based on the history of previous words. The goal of this task is to learn the probability of a sequence of words appearing in a given language. Language modeling is useful for building solutions for a wide variety of problems, such as **speech recognition, optical character recognition, handwriting recognition, machine translation, and spelling correction**.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Text classification* is the task of bucketing the text into a known set of categories based on its content. Text classification is by far the most popular task in NLP and is used in a variety of tools, from **email spam identification** to **sentiment analysis**.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Information extraction* is the task of extracting relevant information from text, such as **calendar events from emails** or the **names of people mentioned** in a social media post.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Information retrieval* is the task of finding documents relevant to a user query from a large collection. Applications like **Google Search** are well-known use cases of information retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Conversational agent* is the task of building dialogue systems that can converse in human languages. **Alexa** and **Siri** are some common applications of this task.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Text summarization* aims to create short summaries of longer documents while retaining the **core content** and preserving the **overall meaning** of the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Question answering* is the task of building a system that can automatically answer questions posed in natural language.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Machine translation* is the task of converting a piece of text from one language to another. Tools like **Google Translate** are common applications of this task.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Topic modeling* is the task of uncovering the topical structure of a large collection of documents. Topic modeling is a common text-mining tool and is used in a wide range of domains, from **literature** to **bioinformatics**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding human language is considered as a difficult task due to its complexity. For example, there is an infinite number of different ways to arrange words in a sentence. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, words can have several meanings and contextual information is necessary to correctly interpret sentences as every language is unique and ambiguous. The ambiguity can be in lexical and syntactic forms.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In lexical ambiguity, a single word has two or more possible meanings. For example, \"I saw bats\".\n",
    "- In syntactic ambiguity, a single sentence or a sequence of words have multiple possible meanings. For example, \"The chicken is ready to eat\".\n",
    "\n",
    "This session will help you understand the basic and advanced NLP concepts and show you how to implement using the most advanced and popular NLP libraries, such as  <a href=\"https://spacy.io/\">spaCy</a> and <a href=\"https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/\">Gensim</a>.\n",

    "For instance, we might see forms like “go”, “goes”, “went”, “gone”, or “going” and we look up dictionary in a lemmatized form, such as \"go\" (Hovy, 2020). These words have clearly different meaning, in some contexts it is not fundamental to distinguish them. On the contrary, it is much more convenient to trace them back to their lemma. Indeed, this may simplify some analysis and allow easier extraction of relevant information from the text. Let's see an example of lemmatization applied to the corpus of tweets using spaCy:"

    "### Stemming \n",
    "\n",
    "Another strategy to reduce different forms of a word to a common base or root form is stemming. Stemming involves removing the suffixes of words to create a simplified form of the word. For example, the stem of the words \"running,\" \"runner,\" and \"run\" is \"run.\" This can be achieved using several algorithms like the one developed by Porter (1980). This algorithm defines a number of suffixes and the order in which they should be removed or replaced. These actions are then applied iteratively untill a word is reduced to its stem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note how, although similar, stemming and lemmatization are different and give different results. Generally speaking, lemmatization tends to produce more accurate and meaningful results with respect to stemming. Nonethelss, stemming is often faster and simpler to implement, which makes it useful for tasks that require real-time processing or have limited computational resources.\n",

    "In natural language processing (NLP), **N-grams** are contiguous sequences of n elements from a given text sample, where an element can be a word, a character, or part of speech. In most cases, n-grams are created from a text by dragging a window of size n over the text and extracting the sequences of n elements that fall within that window.\n",

    "In natural language processing (NLP), stop words refer to words that are frequently used in a language but usually do not have much meaning or semantic value when used in context.

The reason is that they do not contribute much to the overall meaning or topic of a text and can potentially degrade algorithm performance by adding noise to the data. Removing stop words can also help reduce the size of vocabulary and improve the efficiency of text processing algorithms.\n",

    "## 6.2.3. Parts of Speech\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part of speech tagging** (POS) is the process of assigning a part of speech to each word in a sentence, such as noun, verb, adjective, or adverb. POS Tagging is an important step in many NLP applications, such as named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, and machine translation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of POS tagging is to identify the grammatical structure of a sentence by labelling each word with its corresponding part of speech. This information can then be used to extract meaning and context from the text. For example, knowing whether a word is a noun or a verb can help determine the subject and predicate of a sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "POS tagging is typically performed using machine learning algorithms, such as hidden Markov models, conditional random fields, or neural networks. These algorithms are trained on annotated text corpora in which each word is labelled with the corresponding word type. After training, the algorithm can then predict the word type for a new unseen text.\n",
    "\n",
    "POS tagging is not always an easy task, as some words may have multiple possible word types depending on the context. For example, \"run\" can be a verb (\"I run every morning\") or a noun (\"I went for a run\"). In these cases, the algorithm must use contextual clues to determine the most likely part of speech for the word.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, POS tagging is an important technique in NLP that helps extract meaning and context from texts by identifying the grammatical structure of sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "English has 9 main categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "- verb — Expresses an action or a state of being. E.g. jump, is, write, become\n",
    "- noun — identifies a person, a place or a thing or names of particular of one of these (pronoun). E.g. man, house, happiness\n",
    "- pronoun — can replace a noun or noun phrase. E.g. she, we, they, it\n",
    "- determiner — Is placed in front of a noun to express a quantity or clarify what the noun refers to — briefly a noun introducer. E.g. my, that, the, many\n",
    "- adjective — modifies a noun or a pronoun. E.g. pretty, old, blue, smart\n",
    "- adverb — modifies a verb, an adjective, or another adverb. E.g. gently, extremely, carefully, well\n",
    "- preposition — Connect a noun/pronoun to other parts of the sentence. E.g. by, with, about, until\n",
    "- conjunction — glue words, clauses, and sentences together. E.g. and, but, or, while, because\n",
    "- interjection — Expresses emotion in a sudden or exclamatory way. E.g. oh!, wow!, oops!\n",

    "\n",
    "So far we have introduced what are tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, stop words, n-grams, and part of speech tagging. As we have seen, these are all preprocessing techniques that aims at cleaning, removing unnecessary information, and extracting structure from the text. As a last step of this section, we will introduce a technique called TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), which combines the techniques described so far, and finally prepares the texts for the actual analysis, such as topic modeling, text classification, and sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** is a commonly used technique in NLP for analyzing and ranking the importance of words in a collection of documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind TF-IDF is to assign a weight to each word in a document based on how frequently it occurs in the document and how important it is in the overall corpus. This weight is calculated by multiplying two factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Term Frequency (TF)**: this is a measure of how often a word occurs in a document. It is calculated by dividing the number of occurrences of a word in a document by the total number of words in the document. The TF value for a word is high if it occurs very often in a document, and low if it occurs only a few times. In mathematical terms, the TF value for word $t$ in document $d$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)**: This is a measure of how important a word is in a corpus. It is calculated by dividing the total number of documents in the corpus by the number of documents containing the word. The IDF value for a word is high if it occurs in a few documents and low if it occurs in many documents. In general, it is used the logarithm of the IDF factor. Indeed, if a word appears in only a very small number of documents, the resulting IDF value can be very large. This can lead to a situation where the TF-IDF weight of a word is dominated by its IDF value, even if its term frequency (TF) is relatively low. Taking the logarithmof the IDF value has the effect of compressing the range of possible IDF values and reducing the impact of very high IDF values. In mathematical terms, the TF value for word $t$ in a corpus $D$ of $N$ document is:\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",

    "\\end{align}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The TF-IDF weighting $w_{t, d, D}$ for a word $t$ is then calculated by multiplying the TF value and the IDF value for that word:\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "w_{t, d, D} = tf(t, d) \\times idf(t, D)\n",

    "The higher the TF-IDF weighting, the more important the word is in the document or corpus. \n",

    "TF-IDF is generally performed on texts that have been already preprocessed. In the following example, we implement a function that performs TF-IDF on a corpus of texts after preprocessing them using the technique described before: tokenization, lemmatization (or stemming), stop words and punctuation removal. \n",

    "The **Part of speech tagging** (POS tagging) is the process of marking a word in the text to a particular part of speech based on both its context and definition. In simple language, we can say that POS tagging is the process of identifying a word as nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.\n",

    "\n",
    "- verb — Expresses an action or a state of being. E.g. jump, is, write, become\n",

    "- pronoun — can replace a noun or noun phrase. E.g. she, we, they, it\n",
    "- determiner — Is placed in front of a noun to express a quantity or clarify what the noun refers to — briefly a noun introducer. E.g. my, that, the, many\n",
    "- adjective — modifies a noun or a pronoun. E.g. pretty, old, blue, smart\n",
    "- adverb — modifies a verb, an adjective, or another adverb. E.g. gently, extremely, carefully, well\n",
    "- preposition — Connect a noun/pronoun to other parts of the sentence. E.g. by, with, about, until\n",
    "- conjunction — glue words, clauses, and sentences together. E.g. and, but, or, while, because\n",
