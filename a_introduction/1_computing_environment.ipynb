    "This notebook is a preparation for the further sessions. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will be working with the newest Python version (currently 3.9), and we will use Jupyter Notebooks for the teaching. Python versions can be found from here: https://www.python.org/downloads/\n",

    "# 1.1. Download Python to your local computer. <img src=\"./images/python.png\"  width=\"100\" height = \"100\" align=\"right\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "You can directly install Python to your computer. Here, we share the steps with you below:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Select the version of Python to install.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Download Python Executable Installer and run it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For **Windows** users: Don't miss the step to make Python available in the PATH. If you can't call pip or python from the command prompt, it might be necessary that you first add Python and pip to the PATH variable of your computer. \n",
    "    - How to do that:\n",
    "        - Navigate to the file on your computer where python.exe and pip.exe are located and copy the folder path: C:\\Users\\yourusername\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python310\\Scripts\n",
    "        - Then edit the environment variables by navigating to Control Panel -> System and Security -> Sytem -> Advanced System Settings -> Environment Variables. \n",
    "       - Click on the \"Path\" variable and then click on \"Edit\" -> \"New\" and paste your folder path.\n",
    "       \n",
    "- For **Mac** users: The Apple-provided build of Python is installed in /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework and /usr/bin/python, respectively. You should never modify or delete these, as they are Apple-controlled and are used by Apple- or third-party software. \n",
    "    - If you choose to install a newer Python version, you will have more than one but functional Python installations on your computer, so it will be important that your paths and usages are consistent with what you want to do. You can find more information from [here](https://docs.python.org/3/using/mac.html).\n",
