    "# Session 2: Data handling and visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data** has two components: content and structure. Plain text data is unstructured, but its content can also be represented in a structured way. Data representations reside in a continuum of structuration. The rectangular table (also called dataframe or spreadsheet) is the most frequent data format in the social sciences because data is structured. Hierarchical data formats like JSON and HTML are semi-structured, and text data is unstructured (<a href='#weidmann_2022'>Weidmann 2022</a><a id='#weidmann_2022'></a>, ch. 3). In the practice of Computational Social Science, everything revolves around data. The so-called research life cycle consists of the three steps of data collection, data processing, and data analysis. During this cycle, data changes its face: it is transformed from a raw state to a state in which it is ready for analysis. **Data processing** subsumes the steps in which this transformation takes place (Weidmann 2022, ch. 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data management** refers to the practices by which we stay in control of data as a resource. Data is best managed when the focus is on practical questions. Since data processing is the central step of the research life towards answering those questions, it is strategically advantageous to also focus data management on data processing. Computational data processing workflows are advantageous because they fully document all the many steps from data collection to data analysis, they are convenient (like your favorite spreadsheet software could never be), they are replicable (nowadays in high demand by scholarly journals), they can be scaled up (necessary for [big data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data)), and they offer the needed flexibility in the face of semi-structured or unstructured data sources (Weidmann 2022, p.7–9).\n",
    "\n",
    "The **R** language and environment for statistical computing and graphics is very popular in the social sciences, also because it provides the [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/), a collection of mutually adapted packages for tabular data structures, their manipulation (e.g., merging, aggregating), and producing appealing graphics (Weidmann 2022, ch. 7). We argue that **Python** does not need to hide behind R in this regard. The [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) library for managing tables truly is a \"fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool\" that, when combined with the [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) statistical data visualization library, leaves nothing to be desired.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas can also be used in a way that mimics the functionality of **relational databases**. These are systems where the columns of a table are split into multiple tables such that all reduncancies are eliminated. Relational databases are often used in research when the data is either large in volume or rich in content because they ensure consistency and speed up data processing (Weidmann 2022, part 3). The public [TweetsKB](https://data.gesis.org/tweetskb/) corpus of annotated tweets (Fafalios *et al.* 2018) as well as its offspring, the [TweetsCOV19](https://data.gesis.org/tweetscov19/) corpus (Dimitrov *et al.* 2020), are examples where the data is explicitly modeled relationally and can serve as illustrations of meaningful data management.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class='alert alert-block alert-success'>\n",
    "<b>In this session</b>, \n",
    "\n",
    "you will learn how you can manage your data, keep it tidy, and visualize it while keeping a focus on your research questions. In subsession **2.1**, we will have a deep look at the rectangular table. You will experience how you can use the Pandas library to handle tables and mimic a relational database in such a way that your data gets ready for analysis. You will see what it means that relational databases eliminate redundancy and ensure consistency. The TweetsCOV19 dataset will function as an example that will shine up repeatedly in this and subsequent sessions. In subsession **2.2**, we will introduce the NumPy and SciPy libraries. NumPy allows to work with n-dimensional tables called arrays which are typically needed in in data processing. SciPy enables you to efficiently process and analyze very large matrices (i.e., 2-dimensional numerical tables) with many zeros or missing values (which is often the case). Finally, in subsession **2.3**, you will learn how to use the Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries to explore data visually.\n",

    "[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is Python's package for data management and processing using 2-dimensional tables. It allows you to work with any kind of observational or statistical data set, including matrices. Column entries can be heterogeneous (i.e., a single column can contain text, numericals, even lists). Pandas is also well-equipped to handle time series data, as we will see. We start with some illustrative toy examples before we enter the almost-big-data world using the TweetsCOV19 dataset and see how we can save our tables."

    "[Twitter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter) is a microblogging service that is very influential among politicians and journalists. Though stagnating over the past years, the number of monthly active users was at 238 million in the second quarter of 2022 (Wikipedia 2022). Since January 2013, researchers at [L3S](https://www.l3s.de/) and [GESIS](https://www.gesis.org/) have been collecting a 1% random sample of all Twitter posts (tweets), detecting sentiments, and extracting named entities, user mentions, hashtags, as well as URLs, and made those publicly available as the [TweetsKB](https://data.gesis.org/tweetskb/) corpus (Fafalios *et al.* 2018). By August 2022, the corpus had grown to about 3 billion tweets. **In the following**, we will store the content of a small fraction of those tweets, one month of the [TweertsCOV19](https://data.gesis.org/tweetscov19/) corpus (Dimitrov *et al.* 2020), in multiple Pandas dataframes that make reference to the TweetsKB data structure.\n",

Classes and properties are drawn from **ontologies** which are vocabularies for modeling data and, in our particular tweets case, online community data. These vacabularies are developed and maintained by the [Semantic Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web) research community which aims at making internet data machine-readable.\n",

A **user** is modeled as belonging to the [User](https://www.w3.org/Submission/sioc-spec/#term_User) class (in figure 1, the class is called UserAccount) which is defined as a \"User account in an online community site.\" The \"tweet1\" instance of Post as well as the \"usr1\" instance of User have [id](http://rdfs.org/sioc/spec/#term_id) properties which link to the actual [literal](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_literal) values of the **tweet id** (<span style='font-family:Courier'>9565121266</span>) and (encrypted) **user name** (<span style='font-family:Courier'>2356912</span>) variables. Below, we will create separate Pandas tables for the Post and User classes. This is – just like in the above example of populations and capitals – how redundancy is eliminated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting from such an understanding of separate tables for tweets and users, we can discuss to which one some of the other variables belong which come with the data. The **timestamp**, **number of retweets** (number of users that forward the tweet), and **number of favorites** (number of users that like the tweet) clearly are attributes of tweets. In the example of *figure 1*, \"tweet1\" is liked by $12$ users, a statistic that is modeled using the [InteractionCounter](https://schema.org/InteractionCounter) for the [LikeAction](https://schema.org/LikeAction) of the [Schema.org](https://schema.org/) vocabulary. The **number of followers** and **number of friends** (number of users a user follows) seem to be attributes of users at first glance. But since they are measured at the time of tweet creation, they are better also attributed to tweets. While these variables are delived by the Twitter API, the following variables have been obtained by the corpus creators by processing the tweet content. The sentiment or emotional content of a tweet is modeled by using the [Onyx](https://www.gsi.upm.es/ontologies/onyx/) ontology which is \"designed to annotate and describe the emotions expressed by user-generated content\". The [SentiStrength](http://sentistrength.wlv.ac.uk/) algorithm results in **positive sentiment** (1 means low and 5 means high) and **negative sentiment** (-1 means low and -5 means high) variables. Though the sentiment expresses the mind state of a user, it is expressed in language and is, hence, a tweet attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset producers have also annotated tweets by extracting four different kinds of entities from tweet texts: named entities (universally recognized semantic concepts), user **mentions** (words starting with <span style='font-family:Courier'>@</span>), **hashtags** (words starting with <span style='font-family:Courier'>#</span>), and **URLs** (addresses of web pages). Since URLs are often too detailed, we will also extract the **top level domains** (TLDs) from URLs. To identify **named entities**, the [FEL](https://github.com/yahoo/FEL) algorithm matches parts of the tweet **text** to Wikipedia pages as universally identifiable resources and provides a **confidence** score to what extent the match is trustworthy (0 means high and -3 means low confidence). In the example of *figure 2*, the text snippet <span style='font-family:Courier'>Federer</span> has been matched to the Wikipedia resource [Roger_Federer](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Federer) with an average confidence of $-1.54$.\n",

    "|<em style='float: center'>**Figure 3**: Entity relationship diagram to organize Pandas tables</em>|\n",
    "\n",
    "It is clear that named entities, mentions, hashtags, URLs, and TLDs cannot be tweet attributes as that would create an immense amount of redundancy. Hence, they each become tables. ***Figure 3*** shows the entity relationship diagram into which we will transform the tweets data. The diagram mirrors the TweetsKB data structure, and we will construct the tables shown in the figure by following the rules of [database normalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization). Entities are classes in the above sense and not to be confused with named entities. We will create **entity tables** for the seven entities discussed so far: `tweets`, `users`, `named_entities`, `mentions`, `hashtags`, `urls`, and `tlds`. Each table has a primary key (PK) which uniquely identifies the entity instances in a table. We will use the dataframe index as primary keys. Six of those tables have a column called 'tweets' which is the number of times the entity has been selected in a tweet.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, we will create five **relationship tables** that put tweets into relationship to named entities, mentions, hashtags, URLs, and TLDs. Relationship tables are depicted using dashed lines in *figure 3*. They just contain entity identifiers (indices) that are now called foreign keys (FK). We will shortly see that relationship tables can be directly used in data analysis. One of the five tables is an exception: The `tweets_named_entities` table has two more columns – the text that was used to name the named entity and the confidence score – because these are true attributes of the relationship between tweets and named entities. Finally, users and tweets are linked in the tweets table via the 'user_idx' column because a tweet is created by one and only one user.\n",

    "#### Structuring TweertsCOV19\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be working with the May 2020 dump of the TweertsCOV19 corpus. Download this [file](https://zenodo.org/record/4593502/files/TweetsCOV19_052020.tsv.gz) and put it into the `/a_introduction/data` folder. The [description](https://data.gesis.org/tweetscov19/#Dataset) of the dataset says that each row contains variables of a tweet instance, there are twelve variables (columns), and variables are separated by a tab character ('\\t'). In other words, the data is delivered as a table. Furthermore, the description says that sentiment scores, named entity metadata, etc. are concatenated, In other words, the delivered table is wide in selected columns. Our job will be to transform this table into the multiple tables of *figure 3*. Before reading the full data, it is a good idea to look at the first rows to check if the file contains column names and if there are any peculiarities. Using UTF-8 encoding is recommended since it allows for coding many different characters:"

    "Part of what we call \"getting a feeling for your data\" is to actually look at it. For example, here is the right stage in the data processing pipeline to check how well the named-entity-recognition algorithm worked because the `tweets_named_entities` still contains the 'text' from which a named entity was recognized as well as the name of the 'named_entity'. Pandas is actually not the best tool to scan data as it only displays up to 50 rows at a time. You can cycle through your columns using `loc[]`, but it is more convenient to use a spreadsheet editor for the task. Therefore, below we export the distinct rows of the `tweets_named_entities` table to an Excel file. The first column is the tweet index, and you can look up the 'tweet_id' via `tweets.loc[<tweet index without angle brackets>, :]`. You can read the actual tweet of any user (*e.g.*, with the 'tweet id' $1262933787131904001$) by visiting https://twitter.com/anyuser/status/1262933787131904001.\n",

Even though the matching is mostly right in our particular context, the algorithm will also mismatch a lot of discourse about democracy itself. The problem also exists the other way around. The text <span style='font-family:Courier'>dems</span> which is frequently used to name the Democratic Party of the US is matched to [Defensively_equipped_merchant_ship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensively_equipped_merchant_ship) with a slightly weaker confidence of -2.03. The idea is to use this score to filter out bad matchings. However, setting the filter to -2.00 would result in missing the correct matching of <span style='font-family:Courier'>us democratic party</span> which has a score of -2.06. As you go through the spreadsheet you will notive more mistakes. All this points to the general problem of fully automated data processing. The quality of named entity recognition could be improved by using context-sensitive language models which will be introduced in session 9.\n",

It would also be possible to just have three columns in the `tweets` table. However, as we will see in the next subsection, it is beneficial to normalize our data all the way through. Creating those tables is also quite revealing: It shows how easily **wide subtables** can be **made long** when the number of columns is fixed. For comparison, the number of named entities, mentions, etc. per tweet is not fixed. That means, we could not transform the data into a fixed number of columns. But now we can (we have exactly three sentiment categories), and this allows us to dramatically reduce the number of data processing steps. Instead of transforming the concatenated positive and negative sentiment scores into a list (step 1) and appending an average score, we split the concatenated sentiment scores into two columns and write the average score in a third column:"

In practice, particularly if your data is not as rich as this dataset, it may not be necessary to do that. However, even if you can live with some amount of redundancy, it certainly is a way to keep your data tidy and consistent. Having the TweetsCOV19 data in the relational database structure, we will next query it to obtain some first data descriptions. At some point when working with the data even Pandas will reach its limits. It is then time for other libraries to help or take over. We will see how [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) and [SciPy](https://scipy.org/), two fundamental library for scientific computing, can be used to store data in n-dimensional arrays and to compute the co-occurrence of hashtags in tweets using sparse matrices."

    "`np.log10()` is a so-called [universal function](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/ufuncs.html) that goes through the vector item by item. Universal functions are unaware of **data sparsity**. Data is sparse when it contains many zeros or NaNs, depending on the context. `np.log10()` tries to take the logarithm of each cell in a vector even if only one out of 1 million cells is larger than 0. Unawareness of data sparsity can easily cause your computer to run out of memory, for example, when algebraic operations like matrix multiplication are performed. Matrix multiplication is required to obtain **co-occurrence matrices**, for example, of words in documents or hashtags in tweets.\n",

    "The point is that Pandas is not well prepared to handle sparsity. While it offers [data structures for efficiently storing sparse data](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/sparse.html), sparse data processing is hardly developed. This is where SciPy, the other fundamental library for scientific computing comes in. SciPy is the standard library for handling [sparse](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/sparse.html) data, and we will now see how we can obtain the hashtag co-occurrence matrix for the TweetsCOV19 dataset.\n",

    "To be efficient for different kinds of operations, SciPy offers different sparse matrix formats. While chosing the right format is not so important in our case, it is quite important when data gets really big. COOrdinate matrices are fast for constructing sparse matrices. To construct the occurrence matrix `TH` (T for tweets, H for hashtags), the [`coo_matrix()`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.coo_matrix.html) constructor takes as input a (cells, (rows, columns)) triplet.\n",

However, we cannot be certain that the lognormal distribution is the best fit as we have not compared it against other candidate distributions. Knowing about power law behavior is important because, depending on their exponent, power laws do no have characteristic sample variance or even sample mean which is statistically problematic.
