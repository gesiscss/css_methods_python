    "# Session C3. Natural Language Processing\n",
    "The field of study that focuses on the interactions between human language and computers is called natural language processing (NLP).\n",
    "\n",
    "NLP is a field of artificial intelligence in which computers analyze, understand, and derive meaning from human language in a smart and useful way. NLP systems are used exploiting the signals in our language used to predict all of the aforementioned features: people’s age (Nguyen et al., 2011; Rosenthal & McKeown, 2011), gender (Alowibdi et al., 2013; Ciot et al., 2013; Liu & Ruths, 2013), personality (Park et al., 2015), job title (Preoţiuc-Pietro et al., 2015a), income (Preoţiuc-Pietro et al., 2015b), and much more (Volkova et al., 2014, 2015).\n",
    "\n",
    "In NLP, word embeddings have been at the forefront of this progress, which has expanded to include flexible model architectures (Hovy, 2021). The most publicly visible example of this shift is probably the translation quality of services like Google Translate (Wu et al., 2016).\n",
    "\n",
    "A collection of fundamental tasks appear frequently across various NLP projects (Vajjala et al., 2020). Let’s briefly introduce them (Figure 1):\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='images/nlp_tasks.png' style='height: 400px; float: right'>\n",
    "\n",
    "*Language modeling* is the task of predicting what the next word in a sentence will be based on the history of previous words. The goal of this task is to learn the probability of a sequence of words appearing in a given language. Language modeling is useful for building solutions for a wide variety of problems, such as **speech recognition, optical character recognition, handwriting recognition, machine translation, and spelling correction**.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Text classification* is the task of bucketing the text into a known set of categories based on its content. Text classification is by far the most popular task in NLP and is used in a variety of tools, from **email spam identification** to **sentiment analysis**.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Information extraction* is the task of extracting relevant information from text, such as **calendar events from emails** or the **names of people mentioned** in a social media post.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Information retrieval* is the task of finding documents relevant to a user query from a large collection. Applications like **Google Search** are well-known use cases of information retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Conversational agent* is the task of building dialogue systems that can converse in human languages. **Alexa** and **Siri** are some common applications of this task.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Text summarization* aims to create short summaries of longer documents while retaining the **core content** and preserving the **overall meaning** of the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Question answering* is the task of building a system that can automatically answer questions posed in natural language.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Machine translation* is the task of converting a piece of text from one language to another. Tools like **Google Translate** are common applications of this task.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Topic modeling* is the task of uncovering the topical structure of a large collection of documents. Topic modeling is a common text-mining tool and is used in a wide range of domains, from **literature** to **bioinformatics**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding human language is considered as a difficult task due to its complexity. For example, there is an infinite number of different ways to arrange words in a sentence. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, words can have several meanings and contextual information is necessary to correctly interpret sentences as every language is unique and ambiguous. The ambiguity can be in lexical and syntactic forms.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In lexical ambiguity, a single word has two or more possible meanings. For example, \"I saw bats\".\n",
    "- In syntactic ambiguity, a single sentence or a sequence of words have multiple possible meanings. For example, \"The chicken is ready to eat\".\n",
    "\n",
    "This session will help you understand the basic and advanced NLP concepts and show you how to implement using the most advanced and popular NLP libraries, such as  <a href=\"https://spacy.io/\">spaCy</a> and <a href=\"https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/\">Gensim</a>.\n",

    "### 6.1.1. Extracting patterns using Regular Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "<a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.html\">Regular expressions</a> (also called regex, regexes, regex pattern, regexp, or REs) are a sequence of characters that define a search pattern. They are used in programming and text processing to match and manipulate strings of text based on a specific pattern.\n",
    "A regular expression is a pattern used to match one or more text strings. It is usually composed of a combination of characters, symbols, and metacharacters. Metacharacters are special characters that have a specific meaning in regular expressions, for example, the period (.) that matches any single character, or the asterisk (*) that matches zero or more occurrences of the preceding character.\n",
    "Regular expressions can be used to perform a variety of operations on text data, such as searching for specific patterns, replacing text with other text, or extracting specific information from a text string. \n",
    "Some common examples of regular expressions are matching an email addresses, phone numbers, dates, and URLs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions can be complex and difficult to read, but they are a powerful tool for manipulating and processing text data. Luckily, there are many resources that can help us write the correct regular expression for our task. Also, Python has built-in mobule (`re`) to use regular expressions.\n",

    "Another strategy to reduce different forms of a word to a common base or root form is stemming. Stemming involves removing the suffixes of words to create a simplified form of the word. For example, the stem of the words \"running,\" \"runner,\" and \"run\" is \"run.\" This can be achieved using several algorithms like the one developed by Porter (1980). This algorithm defines a number of suffixes and the order in which they should be removed or replaced. These actions are then applied iteratively untill a word is reduced to its stem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note how, although similar, stemming and lemmatization are different and give different results. Generally speaking, lemmatization tends to produce more accurate and meaningful results with respect to stemming. Nonethelss, stemming is often faster and simpler to implement, which makes it useful for tasks that require real-time processing or have limited computational resources.\n",

    "\n",
    "In natural language processing (NLP), **N-grams** are contiguous sequences of n elements from a given text sample, where an element can be a word, a character, or part of speech. In most cases, n-grams are created from a text by dragging a window of size n over the text and extracting the sequences of n elements that fall within that window.\n",
    "\n",
    "N-grams are used in a variety of NLP tasks such as language modeling, machine translation, and text classification. By extracting n-grams from a text, it is possible to capture the local context of a word or word sequence, which can help improve the accuracy of many NLP tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a bigram (n=2) is \"natural language\", a trigram (n=3) is \"natural language processing\", and a 4-gram (n=4) is \"natural language processing task\". By examining the frequency of different n-grams in a text or corpus, it is possible to gain insight into the distribution of words and their relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "N-grams can also be used to generate new texts through techniques such as n-gram language modeling. In this approach, the probabilities of different N-grams in a text are used to generate a new text that is similar in style and content to the original text.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it should be noted that n-grams can be constrained by the sparsity problem, especially for larger values of n. That is, as the value of n increases, the number of unique n-grams in a text can increase rapidly, making it difficult to capture meaningful patterns or relationships. Therefore, choosing an appropriate value of n is an important consideration in many NLP tasks.\n",

    "In natural language processing (NLP), stop words refer to words that are frequently used in a language but usually do not have much meaning or semantic value when used in context.

Removing stop words can also help reduce the size of vocabulary and improve the efficiency of text processing algorithms.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Part of speech tagging** (POS) is the process of assigning a part of speech to each word in a sentence, such as noun, verb, adjective, or adverb. POS Tagging is an important step in many NLP applications, such as named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, and machine translation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of POS tagging is to identify the grammatical structure of a sentence by labelling each word with its corresponding part of speech. This information can then be used to extract meaning and context from the text. For example, knowing whether a word is a noun or a verb can help determine the subject and predicate of a sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "POS tagging is typically performed using machine learning algorithms, such as hidden Markov models, conditional random fields, or neural networks. These algorithms are trained on annotated text corpora in which each word is labelled with the corresponding word type. After training, the algorithm can then predict the word type for a new unseen text.\n",
    "\n",
    "POS tagging is not always an easy task, as some words may have multiple possible word types depending on the context. For example, \"run\" can be a verb (\"I run every morning\") or a noun (\"I went for a run\"). In these cases, the algorithm must use contextual clues to determine the most likely part of speech for the word.\n",

    "- pronoun — can replace a noun or noun phrase. E.g. she, we, they, it\n",
    "- determiner — Is placed in front of a noun to express a quantity or clarify what the noun refers to — briefly a noun introducer. E.g. my, that, the, many\n",
    "- adjective — modifies a noun or a pronoun. E.g. pretty, old, blue, smart\n",
    "- adverb — modifies a verb, an adjective, or another adverb. E.g. gently, extremely, carefully, well\n",
    "- preposition — Connect a noun/pronoun to other parts of the sentence. E.g. by, with, about, until\n",
    "- conjunction — glue words, clauses, and sentences together. E.g. and, but, or, while, because\n",

    "\n",
    "So far we have introduced what are tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, stop words, n-grams, and part of speech tagging. As we have seen, these are all preprocessing techniques that aims at cleaning, removing unnecessary information, and extracting structure from the text. As a last step of this section, we will introduce two techniques, the Bag-of-Words (BoW) approach and its natural extension, a technique called TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency). These approaches combines the techniques described so far, and finally prepares the texts for the actual analysis, such as topic modeling, text classification, and sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In natural language processing (NLP), a **\"bag of words\"** is a representation of a text document that describes the occurrence of words in it. It is a simple and commonly used approach to convert text data into a numerical format that can be used for analysis and machine learning.\n",
    "The bag-of-words model ignores the order and structure of the text and only considers the frequency of occurrence of each word in the document. The resulting representation is a \"bag\" of words in which each word is represented as a separate feature, and the value of each feature is the count of the corresponding word in the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bag-of-words representation of a corpus is usually stored in a matrix called the **document-term matrix**, where each row represents a document and each column represents a term (i.e., a word). The value in each cell is the number of occurrences of the corresponding term in the corresponding document. The document-term matrix is generally a sparse matrix, meaning that it contains a large number of zero elements and few non-zero ones. Indeed, most documents only contain a small fraction of the possible words in a language, and most words occur in only a subset of the documents. This means that the vast majority of the entries in the document-term matrix are zero.\n",

    "Despite its simplicity, the BoW approach is a powerful technique to turn collections of text into a numerical format that can then be inputed to a variety of models for several applications, including topic modeling. Nonetheless, it has some limitations, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Importance of rare words: The bag of words model assigns equal weight to all words in a document, regardless of their importance or rarity. \n",
    "- Discrimination of common words: The bag of words model assigns high weights to common words, which are not very informative and may not be discriminative for distinguishing between different documents. \n",
    "\n",
    "These limitations, can be corrected using the **Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency** (TF-IDF) matrix instead of the simple document-matrix. The idea behind TF-IDF is to assign a weight to each word in a document based on how frequently it occurs in the document and how important it is in the overall corpus. This weight is calculated by multiplying two factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Term Frequency (TF)**: this is a measure of how often a word occurs in a document. It is calculated by dividing the number of occurrences of a word in a document by the total number of words in the document. The TF value for a word is high if it occurs very often in a document, and low if it occurs only a few times. In mathematical terms, the TF value for word $t$ in document $d$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",

    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)**: This is a measure of how important a word is in a corpus. It is calculated by dividing the total number of documents in the corpus by the number of documents containing the word. The IDF value for a word is high if it occurs in a few documents and low if it occurs in many documents. In general, it is used the logarithm of the IDF factor. Indeed, if a word appears in only a very small number of documents, the resulting IDF value can be very large. This can lead to a situation where the TF-IDF weight of a word is dominated by its IDF value, even if its term frequency (TF) is relatively low. Taking the logarithmof the IDF value has the effect of compressing the range of possible IDF values and reducing the impact of very high IDF values. In mathematical terms, the TF value for word $t$ in a corpus $D$ of $N$ document is:\n",
    "\n",

    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "w_{t, d, D} = tf(t, d) \\times idf(t, D)\n",
