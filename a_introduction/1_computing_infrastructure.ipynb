    "\n",
    "In Computational Social Science (CSS), computational methods are applied all along the data life cycle of data collection, data preprocessing, and data analysis. Computational methods are implemented in **programming languages** which enable you to do things that would be either too slow, complicated, or error-prone to do by hand. Many computational methods are already implemented in programming languages, and if the method you desire is not yet implemented, programming languages enable you to implement the method yourself. In principle, it is possible to use multiple languages in a research project, and there is nothing wrong with that in practice. It even forces you to be clear and organized in the steps you do and the files you save to exchange data between languages. Nevertheless, switching between languages is more time-consuming and puts you at risk of losing flexibility instead of gaining it. If it is possible to implement all steps in one language, you may want to do so (<a href='#heiberger_installing_2016'>Heiberger & Riebling, 2016</a>).\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='images/python.png' style='height: 100px; float: right; margin-left: 10px'>\n",
    "\n",
    "The question is **which language** to use for doing CSS? Basically, the main choice is between [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) and [R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)) because those are the two languages in which most of the methods used in CSS are implemented. As a result and a cause, these languages have the largest user communities to which you can go for help. After all, computing is a collective endeavor because, even if you do not code in a group, someone out there will likely have already solved your particular coding problem. Whether Python or R is the better choice depends on you and your research. Lucy Golding from SAGE Campus nicely sums up the [arguments](https://campus.sagepub.com/blog/where-should-i-start-r-or-python):\n",
    "\n",
    "> [L]earning either R or Python will allow you lots of room to grow as a data analyst. They are similar enough that you can transfer much of what you learn for one language to the other.  Both programming languages are free and and open source and developed in the early 90s - R for statistical analysis, and Python as a general-purpose programming language. One could argue that Python has better libraries for data collection and a wider range of data structures, while R has better statistical and graphics libraries, but the best language for you will often depend on what your community uses.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='images/r.png' style='height: 80px; float: right; margin-left: 10px'>\n",
    "\n",
    "**R** has been more of an academic programming language from the start. It offers far more packages for statistical analysis than Python and is very quite for network analysis. As a general-purpose language, **Python** has a more interdisciplinary user base which is also reflected in the methods you will find implemented. Computer scientists choose Python, hence, it is the better choice for machine learning. It is also well-prepared for network analysis. In this course, we use Python because we have a much stronger focus on machine learning than on statistics. Python, like R, is modular, which means, it consists of **packages** (also called libraries), each of which is dedicated to perform a certain type of tasks. There are packages for data management, network analysis, machine learning, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides enabling computational research in the first place, the use a programming language makes research reproducible. **Reproducibility** means that a piece of research represented by the combination of data and methods can be executed repeatedly by the producer of that research or by other researchers with identical results. Full reproducibility makes it necessary to document all data, code, and the package versions that were used in the code (<a href='#schoch_computational_2023'>Schoch *et al.*, 2023</a>). One reason why reproducibility is necessary is that workflows in CSS are often quite complicated. Documentation helps researchers keep an overview of all research steps and, ultimately, ensure research quality. Another reason is that documentation easily allows researchers to collaborate or build upon existing data, methods, or both, all of which is in the general knowledge-production interest of science.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='images/anaconda.png' style='width: 300px; float: right; margin-left: 10px'>\n",
    "\n",
    "To work as a computational social scientists, we need a **computing infrastructure** that enables us to code, collaborate, and make our work reproducible (<a href='#mclevey_doing_2022'>McLevey, 2022</a>, ch. 1). A popular software package that does just that is the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) for Python and R. Its basic functionality is package management: it provides a number of widely-used Python packages that are well tuned to work together, and it offers a controlled way to add further supported packages without the need of deeper programming knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Anaconda distribution provides the **Anaconda Navigator**, a desktop graphical user interface from which you can manage packages and launch coding tools. One such tool is the [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/), such as the one you are currently reading. This is an interactive computing product to develop and document computer code. It is a central component of the computing infrastructure to ensure reproducibility. Jupyter Notebooks contain content cells that can be either code or markdown. The latter are text cells typically used between code cells to explain and document the code. This feature makes Jupyter Notebooks great for teaching and self-teaching and, hence, we use them in this course. The Anaconda Navigator also provides [RStudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/), the integrated development environment for R (and Python).\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='images/git.png' style='height: 50px; float: right; margin-left: 10px'>\n",
    "\n",
    "Another component of the computing infrastructure helps you coordinate your programming work. [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a distributed version control system. If you have a collection of Jupyter Notebooks (or other forms of computer code) that belong together and reside in a directory on your local computer, then you can store all content of this directory (including data, images, or documents) in a **repository** on a Git internet server. Version control means that past versions of your materials are not overwritten when you upload new versions to the server, and you can always go back to older versions. Git is used a lot in the computatinal sciences and the IT industry because it is a comfortable way to also produce computer code in teams. Git, thus, contributes to improving reproducibility by versioning code and opening it up to collaboration. Several companies and projects operate [Git servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git#Git_server_as_a_service) you can use. In the course, we use [GitHub](https://github.com/), and the repository where all teaching materials are stored is https://github.com/gesiscss/css_methods_python.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='images/binder.png' style='width: 200px; float: right; margin-left: 10px'>\n",
    "\n",
    "With the Anaconda distribution and Git, you are set up to start doing CSS on your local machine. But there is an option: you can also execute, develop, and share your Jupyter Notebooks in the **cloud**. That means, your work will not be executed on your local computer but on a server somewhere in the clouds of the internet. You may want to do so if you do not want to set up a local infrastructure (*e.g.*, if you want to check out a foreign repository without downloading it), in addition to your local infrastructure (*e.g.*, if you want to test a different setup), or if you want to make it easy for others to check out your work (*e.g.*, for educative or demonstrative purposes). A driving force in open-source cloud computing is [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) which turns a Git repository into a collection of interactive Jupyter Notebooks. Binder is not persistent, which means, users are responsible to save their changes and results â€“ after 30 minutes of inactivity a user session will be closed automatically and all progress will be lost.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='images/google_colab.png' style='height: 50px; float: right; margin-left: 10px'>\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want persistence, that is, if want to have a user space where you can save your changes and results, there are not many options. [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) is one of them. It offers a standard Python setup for scientific computing. While this makes it easy to use at first glance, it also means that you are either forced to set package versions yourself or adapt your code to the changing setup Google Colab provides. On the other hand, Binder gives you full control over the setup by requiring you to define packages and their versions. These cloud services aid reproducibility because everybody can execute and develop your Jupyter Notebooks without even having a computing infrastructure on their local computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class='alert alert-block alert-success'>\n",
    "<b>In this session</b>, \n",
    "\n",
    "you will learn how to set up your computing infrastructure. All tools you will use are free of charge. In subsession **1.1**, we will guide you through the installation of the Anaconda distribution. We specify a particular release of the distribution so all users of the course materials will work with the same set of package versions and not experience any problems. You will learn how to create a custom environment that has all packages installed in the required versions and to open Jupyter Notebooks. In subsession **1.2**, we will teach the neccessary steps to use Git and download the teaching materials from GitHub to your local computer.
