0,20 States Sue Biden Administration Over New Border Policy,"Wed, 25 Jan 2023 14:58:17 -0500","Twenty states with Republican attorneys general on Tuesday sued the Biden administration over a major change in immigration policy that would turn away more migrants but still allow 360,000 people to legally enter each year from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela.


The lawsuit, filed in a federal court in Texas, accuses the Biden administration of arbitrarily creating recent changes and overstepping its authority. Among those leading the challenge is Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who has succeeded before in temporarily stopping new immigration rules under President Joe Biden.


The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment on the lawsuit late Tuesday.


The changes that Biden announced this month amounted to his boldest move yet to confront the arrival of migrants that have spiraled since he took office two years ago. The four nationalities that Biden addressed now make up the majority of those crossing the border illegally.


There were more than 2.38 million stops during the fiscal year that ended September 30, which is the first time the count topped 2 million. The administration has struggled to clamp down on crossings, reluctant to take hardline measures that would resemble those of the Trump administration.",https://www.voanews.com/a/gop-states-sue-biden-administration-over-new-border-policy-/6933897.html,"[{'term': 'Immigration', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'USA', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}]"
1,"US National Guard Soldier Shoots, Injures Migrant in Texas","Fri, 20 Jan 2023 20:26:34 -0500","U.S. officials say a National Guard member in the Southwestern U.S. state of Texas shot and injured a migrant who was trying to escape from immigration authorities.


Federal officials say the shooting, which was first reported jointly by The Texas Tribune and the Military Times, took place early Monday in Abram, Texas, in the Rio Grande Valley.


According to the joint report, border agents found four migrants in an abandoned house before dawn Monday. Three of the migrants surrendered, but a fourth tried to escape and was shot in the shoulder by a member of the Texas National Guard.


U.S. Customs and Border Protection said the migrant, whose nationality has not been revealed, was taken to a hospital and released later that day.


The Texas Department of Public Safety said a state police agency, the Texas Rangers, is leading an investigation into the shooting.


The National Guard member involved in the shooting was deployed to the border as part of Operation Lone Star, launched by Texas Governor Gregg Abbott in 2021. The operation partners guard members with state police to help manage the influx of migrants at the border.


Stars and Stripes reported that soldiers in the operation can use the minimum force necessary for self-defense or in the defense of others, according to training materials for the operation.


The shooting is the first known incident since the operation began in which a soldier has shot and injured a migrant, according to The Texas Tribune and the Military Times.


Stars and Stripes reported that a U.S. solider fired a rifle while on patrol in January 2022, but no one was injured. Also that month, a service member who was kicked in the face by a migrant aimed a weapon at the migrant but did not fire, according to the outlet.

2,US Border Arrests Drop in January After New Biden Restrictions,"Fri, 20 Jan 2023 19:55:00 -0500","The number of migrants caught crossing the U.S.-Mexico border illegally in January plummeted amid a seasonal slowdown and implementation of new restrictions imposed by U.S. President Joe Biden, a tenuous reprieve as he grapples with record crossings.


U.S. Border Patrol agents have arrested an average of about 4,000 migrants per day in January, three U.S. officials told Reuters this week. That's down from an average of around 7,400 per day during the week before Christmas, one of the officials said.


At the current pace, border arrests could be the lowest since February 2021, a month after Biden took office. But whether the trend will hold for the rest of the month, let alone beyond, remains unclear.


Biden, a Democrat who intends to seek re-election in 2024, earlier this month expanded COVID-19-related restrictions that allow migrants caught at the U.S.-Mexico border to be rapidly expelled back to Mexico.


The restrictions, known as Title 42, had previously been applied to Mexicans, some Central Americans and Venezuelans. They were extended to Cubans, Haitians and Nicaraguans after Mexico had agreed to accept those nationalities.


At the same time, the Biden administration launched a new humanitarian entry program for 30,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans per month if they have U.S. sponsors and enter by air.


""The process we have created is safe, fast and only costs the price of a commercial plane ticket,"" a Biden administration official said. ""Compared to the thousands of dollars smugglers are charging migrants for a dangerous journey, the choice is clear.""


Several U.S. officials said border arrests typically dip in late December into early January due to holidays, which likely contributed to the January drop-off.


U.S. Customs and Border Protection did not immediately respond to a request for comment.


U.S. Border Patrol agents apprehended 206,000 migrants at the southwest border in November.


December figures, which are not yet publicly available, could be higher after an increase in arrivals last month in El Paso, Texas.",https://www.voanews.com/a/us-border-arrests-drop-in-january-after-new-biden-restrictions-/6927912.html,"[{'term': 'USA', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'Americas', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'Immigration', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}]"
3,US Seeking Americans to Sponsor Refugees,"Thu, 19 Jan 2023 16:05:08 -0500","The U.S. State Department has launched a new program to recruit thousands of Americans to help refugees adjust to life in the United States. The program, called “Welcome Corps,” aims to pair vetted refugees with vetted Americans as part of a push to modernize and expand the U.S. refugee resettlement program.


Under the plan, U.S. citizens or permanent residents apply for the program. If approved, groups of at least five people will work to raise $2,275 to sponsor one refugee for the first three months after their arrival. The program is aimed at refugees who intend to settle permanently in the United States.


The State Department calls the plan the biggest change to U.S. refugee admissions in more than four decades, when the U.S. started working with private organizations to sponsor refugees in the 1980s.


Seeking 10,000 Americans


The goal of the program in the first year is to mobilize 10,000 Americans to sponsor 5,000 refugees. The department said officials are looking to recruit members of faith and civic groups, veterans, diaspora communities, businesses, colleges and universities, and other community groups to the program.


The sponsors will be trained how to serve as guides, neighbors, and friends for the refugees. Refugees from any country are eligible.


The program will have two phases, said Julieta Valls Noyes, the Assistant Secretary for Population, Refugees and Migration.


""The first phase, groups of five or more Americans or legal permanent residents can apply to form a private sponsor group,"" she said. ""When certified, they will be matched with a refugee who is already approved for resettlement in the United States.""


In the second phase, expected to begin in the latter half of 2023, Americans who are members of the Welcome Corps will be able to recommend refugees living overseas for resettlement in the U.S. and then assist them once they arrive. The State Department said it will release details of that program later this year.


Hope to restore US as haven


U.S. refugee admission policies have come under criticism from refugee organizations and human rights groups, under both the Trump administration, which slashed the number of refugees admitted, and under the Biden administration.


The administration hopes the program will lead to more refugee admissions. Last year, more than 25,000 refugees were admitted to the United States, only a fifth of President Joe Biden’s stated goal to admit 125,000 refugees per year.


Biden has vowed to restore the U.S. as a haven for those around the world facing violence and persecution, while expanding legal immigration for refugees and migrants with family members or others in the U.S. willing to sponsor them.",https://www.voanews.com/a/us-seeking-americans-to-sponsor-refugees/6925742.html,"[{'term': 'USA', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'Immigration', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}]"

6,New York Mayor Says 'No Room' in His City for Migrants,"Sun, 15 Jan 2023 21:25:48 -0500","The mayor of New York traveled to the Mexican border city of El Paso on Sunday and declared that ""there is no room in New York"" for busloads of migrants being sent to America's most populous city. 


Eric Adams, a Democrat, was also critical of the administration of Democratic U.S. President Joe Biden, saying ""now is the time for the national government to do its job"" about the immigrant crisis at America's southern border. 


The visit of a New York mayor to a southern border city about the issue of immigrants is unprecedented. 


Busloads of migrants have been shipped north to New York and other cities by Republican run states. That has exacerbated a housing crisis in New York and a worsening homeless crisis in the city. 




Adams's trip to El Paso comes after he said the migrant influx into New York could cost the city as much as $2 billion, at a time when the city is already facing a major budget shortfall. 


In recent months the Republican governors of Florida and Texas have sent thousands of migrants seeking sanctuary in the U.S. to cities run by Democratic politicians, including New York, Chicago and Washington, D.C.",https://www.voanews.com/a/new-york-mayor-says-no-room-in-his-city-for-migrants/6919855.html,"[{'term': 'Immigration', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'USA', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'Americas', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}]"
7,"US Stops Hundreds Fleeing Cuba, Haiti By Sea, Returns Most","Thu, 12 Jan 2023 22:17:49 -0500","The Coast Guard returned another 177 Cuban migrants who were caught at sea off Florida to the island on Thursday, while a group of about two dozen Haitians swam ashore in Miami. 


The Cuban migrants were all intercepted separately off the coast earlier this month, according to a Coast Guard news release. They were repatriated by two Coast Guard cutters. 


Twenty-five Haitians who had traveled by sailboat from Port-de-Paix, Haiti, swam ashore at Virginia Key, a small island just southeast of downtown Miami, and were taken into the custody of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, agency spokesperson Michael Selva said. 


Good Samaritans among island beachgoers helped some of the migrants ashore with small boats and jet skis, Selva said. 


Dozens of additional migrants still aboard the sailboat were being processed by federal officials at sea, which typically means they are returned to their home countries. 


Increasing numbers of Cuban and Haitian migrants have attempted the risky Florida Straits crossing in recent months to illegally enter the Keys Island chain and other parts of the state as inflation soars and economic conditions deteriorate in their home countries. 


The spike among Cubans has been especially pronounced. Since Oct. 1, 2022, the Coast Guard has interdicted more than 4,900 Cuban migrants at sea, as compared with more than 6,100 Cubans intercepted during all of fiscal 2022, which ended Sept. 30, according to the news release. 


The latest returns and landings came just after President Joe Biden's administration began a new policy to start turning back Cubans, Haitians and Nicaraguans at the Texas border, along with Venezuelans, who arrive illegally. 


The administration also is offering humanitarian parole for up to 30,000 people a month from those four countries if they apply online, pay their airfare and find a financial sponsor. 


Migrants who arrive illegally and don't immediately return home will become ineligible for the new parole. U.S. officials are hoping this will deter sea arrivals by offering a safer alternative and a pathway to residency. 


The U.S. embassy in Havana, Cuba recently resumed processing migrant visas, and said Wednesday that some initial Cuban applicants already had been accepted under the new parole. In the Haitian capital, Port-au-Prince, would-be applicants have flocked an immigration office in recent days to apply for passports needed for the U.S. program. 


Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Mark Cobb said in a statement that with the new legal pathways available for migrants ""we urge all people to use the safe and legal means available to travel to the United States. Don't put your life at risk by taking to the sea when you don't have to.""",https://www.voanews.com/a/us-stops-hundreds-fleeing-cuba-haiti-by-sea-returns-most-/6916696.html,"[{'term': 'Immigration', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'USA', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'Americas', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}]"
8,Courts Set to Shape US Immigration Policy in 2023,"Thu, 12 Jan 2023 13:54:15 -0500","U.S. judges will be making important rulings on immigration in 2023, playing a significant role in shaping the nation’s immigration policy.


Congress has not revised American immigration laws comprehensively since 1990, and Cornell Law School Professor Stephen Yale-Loehr told VOA that efforts by subsequent administrations to revise the immigration system through executive orders are tied up in court battles.  


“Courts are not a good way to manage immigration,” he told VOA.  


Here are some of the major cases before the courts.


United States v. Texas


In 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments in United States v. Texas, a lawsuit in which the Republican-led states of Louisiana and Texas argued that the Biden administration’s enforcement priorities are unlawful.  


The litigation stemmed from a September 2021 directive from the Department of Homeland Security that focused deportation efforts on people considered an “egregious threat to public safety” or who had committed acts of espionage or terrorism. Anyone in the U.S. without documentation, however, still risks deportation.  


Yale-Loehr said that based on the oral arguments, it is not clear how the court will rule. A decision is expected this term.




Title 42


The Supreme Court justices will also decide the fate of Title 42. The court is to hear arguments in the case in February.


Title 42 is a public health policy that allows for the immediate expulsion of migrants during public health emergencies. The use of the health order, which immigration advocates say is no longer needed, began in March 2020 and has helped to create a backlog in Mexico of migrants seeking asylum in the United States.


In November 2022, a U.S. District Court judge ordered Biden to lift Title 42 restrictions at the U.S.-Mexico border. The case before the Supreme Court is about whether states can challenge that U.S. District Court decision.  


Omar Jadwat, director of the American Civil Liberties Union Immigrants’ Rights Project, said Title 42 is likely to be an ongoing question in 2023 depending on how the Supreme Court rules.  


“There were some disagreements when Title 42 first rolled out over whether it was even possibly justified by public health concerns. But at this point, nobody I think is seriously suggesting that there's any public health justification for Title 42,” Jadwat said.  


DACA


The Biden administration revised the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program in 2022, putting it through the formal rulemaking process to increase its odds of satisfying the arguments that it was not properly created. Since its inception in 2012, it has protected from deportation hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children.




In 2018, Texas and other Republican-led states sued the federal government, arguing that DACA harms states financially because they legally must provide education, health care, and other services to all residents of their states, including undocumented immigrants.


The states further argue that only Congress has the authority to grant immigration benefits.


The case was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, where U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen ruled DACA is unlawful but allowed it to continue for current recipients. That ruling was appealed to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which returned the case to the lower court for further review. The court, however, upheld Hanen’s ruling that DACA is unlawful.


Hanen has yet to schedule a new hearing.


Diversity visa cases


Goodluck v. Biden combines two cases in which tens of thousands of people are fighting for immigrant visas that they were awarded in 2020 and 2021 under the diversity visa program. The visas expired before the winners could receive authorization to travel to the U.S. for reasons related to the pandemic.  


The diversity visa program, commonly known as the green card lottery, is authorized under the Immigration Act of 1990 to increase the diversity among immigrants to the United States.


Visa lottery winners sued and eventually U.S. District Court Judge Amit P. Mehta ordered the Biden administration to reserve more than 7,000 expired diversity visas for the winners whose applications were not prioritized for processing after U.S. consulates reopened as the pandemic eased.  


Immigration lawyer Curtis Morrison told VOA that the federal courts have told the Biden administration it needs to correct the situation for these thousands of visa applicants and their families.


The Goodluck case is now in front of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Oral arguments took place in September after the Department of State appealed Mehta’s order. The diversity visa litigation can affect more than 30,000 people. 


“The department believes the courts misinterpreted the law in finding that the department’s policies were unlawful and that the courts exceeded their authority in ordering the department to process and issue diversity visas beyond the statutory deadline,” according to the State Department’s website.",https://www.voanews.com/a/courts-set-to-shape-us-immigration-policy-in-2023/6915829.html,"[{'term': 'Immigration', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}]"
9,US Grants Migrants Access to Appointment System for Border Crossings,"Thu, 12 Jan 2023 13:24:18 -0500","Migrants seeking asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border can now use a mobile app to schedule a time to approach a land port of entry, a U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesperson confirmed Thursday, a move intended to reduce crossings, but which has sparked concerns over privacy and access. 


The app, called CBP One, is available in English and Spanish. It will allow migrants in Central and Northern Mexico who upload biographical information and a photo to request an appointment at one of eight ports in Texas, Arizona and California, according to a fact sheet. 


The administration had previously announced on Thursday it would expand its use of an app, giving asylum-seekers direct access to enter their information as a pre-screening step to be given an appointment. 


U.S. President Joe Biden's administration touts the app as a more regulated, potentially quicker alternative to crossing the border. But advocates worry asylum-seekers will be required to submit personal information without being guaranteed entry and that some may not have access to a cellphone or internet connection. 


The app rollout comes after Biden last week announced his administration would expand COVID-era Title 42 restrictions to quickly expel Cubans, Haitians and Nicaraguans who cross the border back to Mexico, while opening up legal pathways for those who have U.S. sponsors and enter by air. 


Biden, a Democrat who intends to seek reelection in 2024, has been criticized by Republicans for what they consider permissive border policies amid record crossings. 


Meanwhile, some fellow Democrats, former Biden officials and immigration advocates have lambasted his decision to expand the Trump administration's COVID border restrictions even after the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in April 2021 that they were no longer needed for public health reasons. 


The new access to the CBP One app could help reduce crossings, although questions remain, including how many people are aware of it and how it will function. 


Pete Flores, the top CBP official overseeing ports of entry, tweeted that people could now use the app to view the ""vulnerability criteria"" that would warrant an exception to the Title 42 restrictions.


Tijuana authorities this week said the city would increase internet connectivity in three locations and train officials to assist migrants with applications.",https://www.voanews.com/a/us-grants-migrants-access-to-appointment-system-for-border-crossings-/6915784.html,"[{'term': 'Immigration', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}]"
10,America's Most Popular 2nd Languages Might Surprise You,"Mon, 09 Jan 2023 09:35:13 -0500","The number of people in the United States who speak a language other than English at home tripled between 1980 and 2019, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Almost 68 million people who live in the U.S. — about 1 in 5 — speak a second language at home. That number was 23 million in 1980.


“It says what the country is known for, it's a melting pot,” says Dina Arid, a California mother of three who grew up also speaking Arabic at home. “So, it's good that it's not just primarily English. There's a bunch of immigrants here.”


Arabic is one of the five most-spoken second languages in the U.S. Arid, who speaks mostly English to her children, is trying to teach them a little Arabic.


“Growing up honestly, I had cousins who didn't get to learn Arabic as I did and they always kind of, not resented their parents, but who always wished that their parents spoke to them in Arabic more so that they have that language,” she says.


Spanish is by far the most popular second language in the United States, with more than 41 million people — 12 times more than the other most common second languages — speaking Spanish at home. Hispanics are the largest minority group in the United States. More than half (55%) of Spanish speakers were born in the United States.




The other languages in the top five are Chinese, Tagalog and Vietnamese.


“My parents also spoke English at home but they really tried to keep it, like I would speak English at school during the day and at night I would only speak Vietnamese just so I could keep the language and keep my proficiency at it up and not lose it,” says Jenny Nguyen, a Virginia dental student, whose parents emigrated from Vietnam. “When I was younger, I didn't understand the importance, but I think now I'm very glad that I'm able to speak and write at such a proficient level.”


She was able to put her language skills to use when she traveled to Vietnam to offer free dental care to poor and underserved communities. Many of her peers were also Vietnamese Americans.


“They couldn't really communicate with the patients because they didn't have that baseline level of being able to speak and understand,” Nguyen says. “I was one of the very few young volunteers that were able to speak with the patients and communicate with them what was going on.”


Chinese, Vietnamese, Tagalog and Arabic speakers were more likely to be naturalized U.S. citizens than to not have U.S. citizenship at all, according to the Census Bureau.




Raymond John “R.J.” Mosuela, a Virginia health care recruiter whose parents are from the Philippines, can’t speak their native language, but says he understands when spoken to.


“Tagalog, the main dialect of the Philippines, was spoken in the house but that was also mixing with English,” Mosuela says. “I am the youngest of three brothers. Two of my older brothers were born in the Philippines. Both my parents were born in the Philippines and when they came over here, they had me… my mom will speak to me in Tagalog and I'll respond in English.”


Passing his parents’ native culture along to his children is important to Mosuela.


“When I eventually get married and have kids, maybe not teach the language but at least like preserving the food and our own cultural traditions,” he says.


Cathy Erway, a New York-based food writer, is using a language application to try and become more proficient in her mother’s native Mandarin Chinese.


“The funny thing is that my dad, who is white American, also speaks Chinese,” Erway says. “And so my parents would speak in Chinese to themselves when they didn't want the kids, me and my brother, to hear what they're saying. So, they treated it as this like secret language.”


While more people than ever are speaking a second language at home, the Census Bureau reports that the number of people who spoke only English at home also increased – by about 25% – from 187 million in 1980 to 241 million in 2019.",https://www.voanews.com/a/6903851.html,"[{'term': 'All About America', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'USA', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'Immigration', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}]"
11,"Biden Meets Mexican President for Talks on Trade, Migration, Illegal Drug Traffic","Mon, 09 Jan 2023 01:00:12 -0500","Migration, climate change, trade and manufacturing issues headlined the first day of meetings between the leaders of the U.S., Canada and Mexico, as the host, President Andrés Manuel Lopez Obrador, forcefully urged greater continental integration.    


""Dear President Biden, I am certain that you are a humanistic president, a visionary president,"" Lopez Obrador said as the two leaders sat down with high-level delegations for a bilateral meeting Monday night. ""And that there are conditions that couldn't really be better to initiate a new policy of integration, of economic social integration, Mr. President, in our continent.""   


Biden and Lopez Obrador held the first of a series of meetings that will continue on Tuesday and will also include Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, part of a regional summit between the three leaders.    


The U.S. president and his wife, Jill Biden, were greeted Monday by Lopez Obrador and his wife, Beatriz Gutierrez, for a welcome ceremony at the National Palace.    


And on Monday evening, Biden, Trudeau and Lopez Obrador had dinner along with their spouses.    


Trade    


On Monday, Lopez Obrador called for greater economic integration on the continent.    


""This is the moment for us to determine to do away with this abandonment, this disdain,"" he said. ""And this forgetfulness for Latin America and the Caribbean, which is opposed to the policy of the good neighborhood, of the titans of freedom and liberty … starting with you, because there would be no other leader that could implement this enterprise.""    


The White House noted that the talks were nuanced and complex.    


""These are sensitive conversations, they're best done behind closed doors, but the president certainly comes with that as a key part of his economic agenda here,"" national security adviser Jake Sullivan told journalists in Mexico City.    


Amigo a amigo    


Sullivan also said there is a personal element to this summit, which is often referred to as the ""3 Amigos"" summit.    


""This trip is a good opportunity for President Biden to deepen his personal engagement with President Lopez Obrador and Prime Minister Trudeau,"" Sullivan told reporters in Mexico City on Monday. ""Yesterday he had the opportunity to ride with President Lopez Obrador from the airport back into town, which gave them the chance to just have a one-on-one chat of how they're seeing the world right now, what's on their minds. I think they both got a lot out of it.""    


Sullivan declined to give details of the conversation, but the leaders' Sunday night ride from the new Felipe Angeles International Airport, through the darkened residential outskirts of the capital and into the heart of the city, lasted about an hour.  


Migration  


Biden arrived late Sunday in Mexico after visiting the Texas city of El Paso for a firsthand look at the influx of thousands of undocumented migrants crossing the border with Mexico. 




Earlier, during a visit to the border city, Biden stopped at the Bridge of the Americas port of entry, where he met with Customs and Border Protection officers. He also walked a stretch of the U.S.-Mexico border wall that separates the Texas city from Ciudad Juarez with two Customs and Border Protection agents.    


Before leaving for Mexico City, he also visited the El Paso County Migrant Support Center where he met with local officials and community leaders.




Upon his arrival in Texas, Biden was met by Governor Greg Abbott, who handed Biden a letter. Abbott cited ""chaos"" in his state, saying the situation is the result of Biden failing to enforce federal immigration laws.    


Biden tweeted after his visit that it is possible to secure the U.S.-Mexico border and make the immigration process ""orderly, fair, safe and humane.""    


""My administration is using the tools available to limit illegal migration, expand legal pathways to immigration, and increase security,"" Biden said. ""The approach we're taking is based on a model we know works. But to truly fix our broken immigration system, Congress needs to act.""  


Biden's visit came days after announcing that 30,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans per month would be allowed into the United States and be able to work legally for up to two years if they apply from abroad, pass a background check and prove they have a financial supporter in the U.S.  




When asked if the U.S. government plans to accept more than 30,000 migrants under the new program, Sullivan said the government has established numerical targets, and they will ""see how it goes"" to then make determinations.    


""By the end of this summit, we are not going to have a new agreement as a deliverable here,"" he said. ""What we need is to see how the program, announced last week, works in practice, [and] what, if any, adjustments need to be made to that program, and then we can talk about taking the next step.""    


Biden officials said those who fail to apply for the program and cross into the U.S. without authorization will be removed to Mexico under a pandemic-era health order that allows for quick expulsion of migrants.    


The order, known as Title 42, was put in place over concerns of the spread of the coronavirus as the reason to keep out the migrants trying to enter the U.S. at or in between ports of entry.    


Migrants are also subjected to deportation to their home country after going through expedited removal if they enter the U.S. without authorization.

He has the same message for U.S. President Joe Biden, who visited the Texas city of El Paso, just across the border, on Sunday.


""We hope he helps us, that he lets us pass, since we're suffering a lot here in Mexico,"" said Marquez, 32. ""He has to listen to the people on this side.""


Biden's first border visit as president comes days after a new policy aimed at reducing illegal migration has been criticized by migrant advocates for limiting asylum access.


The two-pronged approach offers legal pathways to the United States for certain Cubans, Nicaraguans, Haitians and Venezuelans who have U.S. sponsors, while expelling people of those nationalities back to Mexico if they attempt to cross the border without permission.




Mexican migration agents and state police on Saturday patrolled the concrete banks of the Rio Grande river dividing Ciudad Juarez and El Paso, as groups of families attempted to clamber through loops of concertina wire into the United States.


""Duck down,"" Erlan Garay of Honduras instructed a Colombian woman and her three children, including an 8-year-old boy clutching a Spiderman toy.


""They're going to request asylum, they have a chance,"" he said, adding that he would look for somewhere else to clandestinely cross, and shrugging off a drop of blood where the fence pricked his hand.


Marquez said he and his partner, Yalimar Chirinos, 19, do not qualify for the new legal entry program because they lack a U.S. sponsor.


""They're constantly changing the laws, every week,"" Chirinos said, wearing a black hoodie and a single pink-and-blue glove to try to ward off the cold.


The couple has spent five months in Mexico after crossing several countries and the dangerous Darien jungle between Colombia and Panama. They sleep at night on the street without a tent or blankets, hugging one another to stay warm, wary of criminals known to rob and kidnap migrants.


At one point they crossed undetected into Texas, but after several days without food or a place to stay, they turned themselves in to U.S. officials, who sent them back to Mexico.


Marquez said he will stick it out another 15 days hoping to find a legal route into the United States, before looking for a way back to Venezuela.


""I don't want to be here anymore,"" he said, breaking into tears. ""Mr. President, if you're going to deport me, deport me back to my country, not back here to Mexico.""


Others were undeterred, even after their own expulsions to Mexico.


""Send me wherever you want, I'll come back,"" said Jonathan Tovar, 29, speaking on Friday from behind the fence of Mexico's migration office in Ciudad Juarez. ""I want the president of the United States to give me and my family a chance.""",https://www.voanews.com/a/listen-to-people-on-this-side-migrants-in-mexico-say-as-biden-visits-border/6910040.html,"[{'term': 'Immigration', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'USA', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'Americas', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}]"
14,Biden Tours Busy US Border Crossing Handling Migrant Influx,"Sun, 08 Jan 2023 02:53:24 -0500","U.S. President Joe Biden flew to the Texas city of El Paso on Sunday for a firsthand look at the influx of thousands of undocumented migrants crossing the border with Mexico. 


During his roughly four-hour visit to the border city, Biden stopped at the Bridge of the Americas port of entry where he met with Customs and Border Protection officers and watched as they demonstrated how they search vehicles at the border for drugs, money and other contraband. 


Biden also walked a stretch of the U.S.-Mexico border wall that separates the Texas city from Ciudad Juarez. Two Border Patrol agents walked with the president.


He also visited the El Paso County Migrant Support Center where he met with local officials and community leaders. He left for Mexico City shortly after.


Upon his arrival in Texas, Biden was met by Governor Greg Abbott, who handed Biden a letter. Abbott said the letter “provided five solutions that already exist under current United States law"" that would help in securing the border.


Biden’s visit came days after announcing that 30,000 Cubans, Nicaraguans, Haitians and Venezuelans would be allowed into the U.S. per month and allowed to work legally for up to two years if they apply from their home countries, pass a background check and prove they have a financial supporter in the U.S.  




But Biden says they will be deported to Mexico if they enter the U.S. illegally, an expansion of a pandemic-era immigration policy that cited concerns over the spread of the coronavirus as the reason to keep out the waves of migrants trying to enter the United States. 


In advance of the trip, the White House said Biden, long attacked by Republican opponents as soft on border security, will assess enforcement operations on his first trip to the border during his two years in the White House. 


It said the president would meet with local officials who have been processing the arrival of “the historic number of migrants fleeing political oppression and gang violence” in the four countries. 


But thousands of undocumented migrants are also arriving from other places, largely but not exclusively from Central American countries, and have overwhelmed border agents. Many of the migrants are administratively processed at the border but allowed to enter the U.S. on a promise to appear at later court hearings to consider their asylum requests. Others are turned back at the border. 




In all, 2.38 million migrant encounters were recorded at various points along the U.S.-Mexico border in the fiscal year that ended in September. It’s the first time the annual number topped 2 million. Some of those instances were repeat encounters with migrants who tried to enter more than once.    


El Paso is one of the largest U.S. cities on the border with Mexico, where thousands of migrants arrive daily.     


U.S. presidents — both Democrats like Biden and former President Barack Obama and Republicans Donald Trump and George W. Bush — have for years been unable to reach agreement with Congress on a coherent immigration policy to control the wave of migrants looking to escape violence, political persecution and poverty in their home countries for the possibility of a better life in the U.S. 


Biden’s Republican opponents have blamed him and Homeland Security chief Alejandro Mayorkas for the current disarray at the border.  


Republicans who now narrowly control the U.S. House of Representatives say they will hold hearings on the issue. In a visit to the border in November, before he became the new House Speaker, Kevin McCarthy called for Mayorkas’s resignation, and vowed to try to impeach him and convict him of malfeasance in office to remove him if he does not quit.


But Mayorkas told ABC’s “This Week” show Sunday he has no plans to resign. 


“I will continue to do my work,” he said, and is accompanying Biden to the border. Mayorkas said that immigration issues are “gripping the hemisphere” and through the decades have been left unresolved by successive presidents and sessions of Congress. 


Biden’s new order affecting migrants from Cuba, Nicaragua, Haiti and Venezuela has been attacked by longtime Republican foes like Texas Governor Abbott. Four Democratic political allies of Biden, Senators Robert Menendez, Corey Booker, Alex Padilla and Ben Ray Lujan, and immigration advocates have assailed the administration for continuing to use the coronavirus reasoning of the Trump administration to expel migrants.  


In the ABC interview, Mayorkas said court rulings have prohibited the Biden administration from changing the rules governing entry into the U.S. and its use of the coronavirus provision to expel migrants arriving at the border.  


Abbott, who has dispatched busloads of migrants to northern cities with Democratic mayors to force them to cope with the influx of new arrivals, said Biden’s trip to the border won’t amount to much more than a photo op. 


He told Fox News the new plan trying to control migration from four countries has “no details whatsoever about what the Biden administration is going to do to stop people from coming across the border illegally.” 


On his Texas trip, Biden will visit the El Paso County Migrant Services Center and meet with nonprofits and religious groups that support migrants arriving to the U.S. It is not clear whether Biden will talk to any migrants. 


""The president's very much looking forward to seeing for himself firsthand what the border security situation looks like,"" said John Kirby, White House national security spokesman. ""This is something that he wanted to see for himself."" 


For all his international travel over his 50 years in public service, Biden has not spent much time at the U.S.-Mexico border.  


The White House noted only that he had driven by the border during his failed bid for the presidency in 2008. He sent Vice President Kamala Harris to El Paso in 2021, but she was criticized for largely bypassing the then-key migrant entry points, because El Paso wasn't the center of crossings that it is now. 


Trump, who has announced a bid to reclaim the White House in 2024, traveled to the border several times and often assailed the influx of migrants. 


He started construction of a border wall, but Biden abandoned the project after defeating Trump in the 2020 election. Trump repeatedly said Mexico would pay for the wall, but then-Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto tweeted in 2018, ""NO. Mexico will NEVER pay for a wall. Not now, not ever. Sincerely, Mexico (all of us)."" 


American taxpayers ended up footing the bill for the portion of the wall that was built. 


After the El Paso stop, Biden is headed to Mexico City where he is meeting Monday and Tuesday with Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for a North American leaders’ summit, where immigration and other issues are on the agenda.  


White House correspondent Anita Powell in El Paso, Texas, contributed to this story.

15,"‘Can’t Go Forward, Can’t Go Back’: Migrants Fear US Immigration Rules","Sat, 07 Jan 2023 20:37:38 -0500","Several hundred people marched through the streets of El Paso on Saturday afternoon, and when they arrived at a group of migrants huddling outside a church, they sang to them ""No estan solos"" — ""You are not alone.""


Around 300 migrants have taken refuge on sidewalks outside Sacred Heart Church, some of them afraid to seek more formal shelters, advocates say, amid new restrictions meant to crack down on illegal border crossings.


This is the scene that will greet President Joe Biden on his first, politically thorny visit to the southern border Sunday.


The president announced last week that Cubans, Nicaraguans, Haitians and Venezuelans will be expelled to Mexico if they enter the U.S. illegally — an expansion of a pandemic-era immigration policy called Title 42. The new rules will also include offering humanitarian parole for up to 30,000 people a month from those four countries if they apply online and find a financial sponsor.


Biden is scheduled to arrive in El Paso on Sunday afternoon before traveling on to Mexico City to meet with North American leaders on Monday and Tuesday.


Dylan Corbett, who runs the nonprofit Hope Border Institute, said the city is experiencing an increasing ""climate of fear.""


He said immigration enforcement agencies have started ratcheting up deportations to Mexico, and he senses a rising level of tension and confusion.


The president's new policy expands on an existing effort to stop Venezuelans attempting to enter the U.S., which began in October.


Corbett said many Venezuelans have since been left in limbo, putting a strain on local resources. He said expanding those policies to other migrants will only worsen the circumstances for them on the ground.




""It's a very difficult situation because they can't go forward and they can't go back,"" he said. People who aren't processed can't leave El Paso because of U.S. law enforcement checkpoints; most have traveled thousands of miles from their homelands and refuse to give up and turn around.


""There will be people in need of protection who will be left behind,"" Corbett said.


The new restrictions represent a major change to immigration rules that will stand even if the U.S. Supreme Court ends a Trump-era public health law that allows U.S. authorities to turn away asylum-seekers.


El Paso has swiftly become the busiest of the Border Patrol's nine sectors along the U.S. border with Mexico, occupying the top slots in October and November. Large numbers of Venezuelans began showing up in September, drawn to the relative ease of crossing, robust shelter networks and bus service on both sides of the border, and a major airport to destinations across the United States.


Venezuelans ceased to be a major presence almost overnight after Mexico, under Title 42 authority, agreed on Oct. 12 to accept those who crossed the border illegally into the United States. Nicaraguans have since filled that void. Title 42 restrictions have been applied 2.5 million times to deny migrants a right to seek asylum under U.S. and international law on grounds of preventing the spread of COVID-19. Many migrants try to cross the border more than once.


U.S. authorities stopped migrants 53,247 times in November in the El Paso sector, which stretches across 425 kilometers of desert in West Texas and New Mexico but sees much of its activity in the city of El Paso and suburban Sunland Park, New Mexico. The most recent monthly tally for the sector was more than triple the same period of 2021, with Nicaraguans the top nationality by far, followed by Mexicans, Ecuadoreans, Guatemalans and Cubans.


Many gathered under blankets outside Sacred Heart Church. The church opens its doors at night to families and women, so not all of the hundreds caught in this limbo must sleep outside in the dropping temperatures. Two buses were available for people to warm up and charge their phones. Volunteers come with food and other supplies.


Juan Tovar held a Bible in his hands, his 7-year-old daughter hoisted onto his shoulders. The 32-year-old was a bus driver in Venezuela before he fled with his wife and two daughters because of the political and financial chaos that has consumed their home country.


He has friends in San Antonio prepared to take them in, he said. He's here to work and provide an education for his daughters, but he's stuck in El Paso without a permit.


""Everything is in the hands of God,"" he said. ""We are all humans, and we want to stay.""


Another Venezuelan, 22-year-old Jeremy Mejia, overheard and said he had a message he'd like to send to the president.


""President Biden, I ask God to touch your heart so we can stay in this country,"" Mejia said. ""I ask you to please touch your heart and help us migrants have a better future in the U.S.""",https://www.voanews.com/a/can-t-go-forward-can-t-go-back-migrants-fear-us-immigration-rules-/6909086.html,"[{'term': 'Immigration', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'USA', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'Americas', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}]"
16,VOA Interview: Homeland Security Secretary Mayorkas,"Thu, 05 Jan 2023 20:38:56 -0500","U.S. President Joe Biden announced measures Thursday to prevent migrants from entering the United States without authorization from Mexico, while offering a new pathway to legal entry for up to 30,000 people a month under its “humanitarian parole” program now available to refugees from Ukraine and Afghanistan.


Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas told VOA that online applications for humanitarian parole for Cubans, Nicaraguans, Haitians and Venezuelans will start ""immediately, whether it's today or tomorrow, but immediately we're going to begin making this program accessible.""




“It's extraordinarily important that we provide a safe, humane, orderly way for individuals to arrive at the United States,” Mayorkas said in a White House interview.


The following transcript has been edited for brevity and clarity:


VOA: How is the Department of Homeland Security dealing with the arrival of hundreds of Cuban and Haitians by sea to Florida?


Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas: What we have done historically, and we are continuing to do, is to deploy our United States Coast Guard, which interdicts individuals seeking that perilous journey and returns them to Cuba or to a different country, depending on the circumstances. Do not take to the seas. We have seen too much travesty.


VOA: Are you expecting an increase in people coming by sea from Haiti and Cuba after this announcement?


Mayorkas: We're watching it very closely. That would be a grave mistake for people to do it. They will not succeed. We will exercise our legal authorities. People who take these irregular paths, these dangerous paths, not only risk their lives, but they risked their lives only to fail in their mission.


Because what we are doing is, we are providing lawful pathways, but we're delivering consequences for people who don't use those lawful pathways that we've made available to them. So, they will be expelled under Title 42 or returned under our Title 8 authorities.


VOA: Once Mexico accepts those 30,000 migrants that they agreed to accept every month, what happens if more people continue to come to the U.S. border? What will happen to them?


Mayorkas: Mexico's decision is a decision that Mexico made independently, unilaterally. ... What I said earlier today stands true: We're going to respond to what we experience at our southern border. And so, we will accelerate or add additional measures that will respond to the situation, because we are very committed to providing humanitarian relief, but we are very committed to providing that relief in a safe and orderly way and delivering consequences for people who don't use them.


VOA: Have you reached agreements with other countries to take migrants?


Mayorkas: We have worked throughout the region with other countries. This is a regional challenge. So many countries are experiencing increased migration; the displacement of people is unprecedented. We're working with those other countries. Take a look at Colombia. Colombia has accepted 2.4 million Venezuelans. Costa Rica is accepting now an unprecedented number of Nicaraguans. A regional challenge requires a regional solution.


VOA: But you can't send Venezuelans back to Venezuela, for example?


Mayorkas: We do not have a relationship with Venezuela. Venezuela does not accept the return of its citizens.",https://www.voanews.com/a/voa-interview-homeland-security-secretary-mayorkas-/6906731.html,"[{'term': 'Immigration', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'USA', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'Americas', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}]"

18,Biden Announces New Border Measures to Curb Unlawful Migration to US,"Thu, 05 Jan 2023 20:04:53 -0500","U.S. President Joe Biden announced Thursday measures to crack down on migrants seeking to enter the United States without authorization from Mexico while offering a new pathway to legal entry for up to 30,000 people a month from Venezuela, Nicaragua, Cuba and Haiti.


The measures will make it easier for border authorities to quickly expel migrants who enter the U.S. between legal crossing points and revive country agreements where would-be asylum-seekers, who passed through a third country, must show they failed to receive protections there before asking for asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border.


However, individuals in the four named countries will be allowed to apply for legal entry to the United States from abroad under the humanitarian parole authority now being used to admit some refugees from Afghanistan and Ukraine.


Biden officials touted the plan as a pathway to legally allow migrants to travel to the U.S. in an orderly, safe manner. But immigration advocates countered that the policies inappropriately limited asylum protections guaranteed under U.S. and international law.




During a news conference at the White House, Biden said the humanitarian parole measure would allow migrants from Nicaragua, Cuba and Haiti who have U.S.-based financial sponsors to legally enter the country through a program modeled on the Ukraine program and an earlier Venezuelan program. Those programs allow migrants to travel by air to the U.S. if they have sponsors and pass background checks.


“These actions alone that I’m announcing today aren’t going to fix our immigration system, but they can help us a good deal. … I can only act where I have the legal capacity to do so,” Biden said.


The humanitarian parole authority allows the approved applicants to live and work legally in the U.S. temporarily.


In response to the announcement, Krish O’Mara Vignarajah, president and CEO of Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, said in a statement that humanitarian parole cannot be a replacement for asylum protections.


“It will provide only temporary protection to a small subset of the millions of people forced to flee their homes. Far more concerning is the expansion of Title 42 expulsions that will now apply to more people seeking to exercise their legal right to seek asylum,” she said.




Title 42 is a public health policy that allows for the immediate expulsion of migrants during public health emergencies. But there were exceptions that allowed migrants from Venezuela, Nicaragua, Cuba and Haiti to be processed into the U.S. Under the new plan, if they arrive at the southwestern border, they will instead be returned to Mexico.


The use of the health order, which immigration advocates say is no longer needed, created a backlog in Mexico of migrants seeking asylum in the U.S.


In various reports, U.S. border officials and immigration advocates say the larger numbers of migrants at the border reflect the deteriorating economic and political conditions in some countries that drive people to come to the southwestern border of the U.S.


Other Biden officials also briefed reporters Thursday, on the condition that their names not be used as is common in White House briefings, saying the humanitarian pathway will keep migrants from making the dangerous journey to the U.S. border.


However, the plan has a limit of 30,000 total admissions each month.


“Currently, these four countries accounted for most of the people traveling into Mexico to start a new life by getting to the American border and trying to cross,” Biden said.


The new initiative includes efforts to discourage unlawful entries along the southwestern border.


U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in a news conference with reporters that “effective immediately” migrants would be “swiftly sent back to Mexico.”


“The border is not open,” Mayorkas said, adding that border officials would increase the use of expedited removal.


A migrant is fast-tracked for removal if a U.S. immigration officer concludes the person does not have a valid asylum claim, a determination made without the migrant appearing before an immigration judge. Unaccompanied children who cross the border into the United States are exempted from the policy.




Mexico has agreed to accept up to 30,000 migrants a month who do not qualify for the humanitarian program.


How program will work


According to Biden officials, a migrant requesting humanitarian parole will have to file an applications with Customs and Border Protection through the CBP One app, submit proof of an eligible sponsor and and pass a background check to receive authorization to travel to the United States.


For two years, the beneficiaries of the parole program will have legal status and be allowed to legally work in the U.S.


Biden and Mayorkas made a point to say that after Thursday’s announcement, individuals who cross Panama and Mexico to get to the U.S. border and cross without authorization will not be eligible for the parole process and will be subject to immediate expulsion.


At Thursday’s news conference, Mayorkas said there would be discretion but did not elaborate on what exceptions — still to be written — might be granted.


Mayorkas said migrants who “circumvent available established pathways to lawful migration and also failed to seek protection in a country to which they traveled on their way to the United States” would be ineligible for asylum in the United States.


“Unless they meet exceptions that will be specified, individuals who cannot establish a valid claim to protection under the standard set out in the new rule will be subject to prompt removal under Title 8 authorities, which carries a five-year ban on re-entry,” he said.


Reaction


Jonathan Blazer, director of border strategies at the American Civil Liberties Union, said in a statement that Biden recognized that seeking asylum is a legal right, but the plan continues to tie the current administration to anti-immigrant policies instead of restoring access to asylum protections.


“President Biden explicitly condemned [former President Donald] Trump’s asylum ban against people who travel through other countries and made a campaign promise to end it and restore our asylum laws. But today the White House announced that he plans to bring a version of that ban back,” Blazer added.


Other immigration advocates criticized the sponsorship requirement for those seeking asylum.


Austin Kocher, an assistant professor and researcher with the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University, told VOA the Biden administration is understandably under pressure to create a sense of control at the border.


“But adding conditions and barriers to the asylum process that are not part of U.S. and international law contradicts Biden’s claims that he would be different than his predecessor,” he said.




Mayorkas and other immigration officials rebutted that claim.


“This has no resemblance to the transit ban that was imposed in the Trump administration because we have built lawful pathways. We do have a way for asylum-seekers to seek relief at the ports of entry. We will, of course, have exceptions for humanitarian reasons when individuals cannot avail themselves of the CBP One application. So, this is quite, quite different,” Mayorkas said.


Biden is scheduled to travel to El Paso, Texas, this weekend. It will be his first trip to the southwestern border as president. He said he waited to see what was going to happen to Title 42, which is tied up in a case before the U.S. Supreme Court, before he decided to visit the border.


“I wanted to make sure that I knew what the outcome or at least the near outcome was on Title 42 before I went down [to the border]. We don't have that yet. So I had to operate. I don't like Title 42, but it's the law now and we have to operate within it,” Biden said.

19,Migrants Crowd Mexico's Refugee Offices Amid Fears of US Policy Change,"Wed, 04 Jan 2023 22:29:18 -0500","Thousands of migrants have flocked to government offices in southern Mexico seeking asylum since the United States said it would keep restrictions used to quickly expel hundreds of thousands of migrants who have crossed the U.S.-Mexico border. 


Last month, the U.S. Supreme Court said it would maintain a pandemic-era measure for expediting expulsions of undocumented migrants to Mexico until it had time to consider Republican arguments against its repeal, which U.S. President Joe Biden said could extend the curbs until at least June.  


Meanwhile, Biden administration officials told Reuters the measure known as Title 42 could soon be applied to more nationalities, including Cubans, Nicaraguans and Haitians, stirring fears of expulsions and encouraging migrants to seek asylum to safeguard freedom of movement inside Mexico, analysts and officials say. 




Cuban migrant German Ortiz, who is waiting to apply for asylum in the Mexican city of Tapachula near the Guatemalan border, wants to make his way quickly to the United States. 


""Once the new law is enforced, they'll close the road to us,"" said Ortiz, who arrived in Tapachula on December 31. ""We don't want to risk it, we must get to the border now."" 


Up to 5,000 in two days


Mexico currently accepts only certain nationalities expelled from the United States, but it is expected to take in more soon under Title 42 as Washington deals with a record 2.2 million migrants arrests at the U.S. southwest border in 2022.  


Title 42 was originally put in place to curb the spread of COVID, but U.S. health authorities have since said it is no longer needed for public health reasons. Immigrant advocates say the policy is inhumane and it exposes vulnerable migrants to serious risks, like kidnapping or assault, in Mexican border towns. 


Andres Ramirez, head of Mexico's Commission for Refugee Assistance, estimated that up to 5,000 migrants turned up at the Tapachula offices of the commission — known as COMAR — on January 2 and 3, among the largest groups the agency has ever seen in such a short time. Many of the migrants included Haitians and Nicaraguans. 




Ramirez said many migrants seek asylum to obtain documents they believe are necessary to traverse Mexico so they can then go to the U.S.-Mexico border later. Mexico has sought to contain mass movement of migrants toward the U.S. border by breaking up caravans and setting up checkpoints throughout the country. 


Ramirez believed the mass of recent arrivals could be migrants from Cuba, Nicaragua and Haiti seeking to reach the United States before rules change. 


""They're trying to run,"" he said. 


Migration on agenda


Police in Tapachula and the National Guard erected fences around COMAR offices to block large crowds of migrants, Reuters images show. 


""I've been sleeping here since January 1, waiting for them to help me, to give me shelter,"" said Mauricio Hilario, a 27-year-old Salvadoran migrant camping outside the COMAR building with dozens of other people, including small children. 


Nearly 400,000 migrants were detained in Mexico through November, twice as many as in 2019, official data show. 


Migration is expected to feature prominently on the agenda when U.S. President Joe Biden meets his Mexican and Canadian counterparts for a leaders' summit next week in Mexico City. 


Lorena Mena, director of Continente Movil, a think tank specializing in migration issues, said any expansion of Title 42 would likely increase risky migration because traffickers will encourage expelled migrants to keep crossing the border as they have not been officially deported. 


""The fact that people cross borders does not take away their rights, among them, to request asylum,"" she added, saying many will try again. 


Some migrants, such as Raquel, a 44-year-old Venezuelan who was selling boiled eggs with salt to pay for a small, shared room in Tapachula, expressed hope the summit could yield a plan that will make it easier to reach the United States. 


""I'd like both countries to help us and give us a chance to get in ... legally without having to risk crossing Mexico or turning ourselves in,"" she said.",https://www.voanews.com/a/migrants-crowd-mexico-s-refugee-offices-amid-fears-of-us-policy-change-/6905162.html,"[{'term': 'Americas', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'USA', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'Immigration', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}]"
