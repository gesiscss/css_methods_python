    "# Session D4. Topic modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Topic modeling** is a technique in natural language processing (NLP) used to uncover underlying themes in a large corpus of text. The goal of topic modeling is to identify the most important topics in a collection of documents and to extract the most important words and phrases associated with each topic. There are several popular topic modeling algorithms, including **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)** and Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF). These algorithms are **unsupervised**, meaning that they do not require labeled data. On the contrary, they are based on the assumption that words that frequently occur together in a document are likely to be associated with the same topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Topic modeling typically involves the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Preprocessing the data: The text data is cleaned and preprocessed to remove unnecessary information such as stop words, punctuation, and special characters.\n",
    "- Vectorization: the preprocessed text data is converted into a numerical vector representation, such as a bag-of-words or TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) matrix.\n",
    "- Model training: a topic modeling algorithm is applied to the vectorized text data to identify the main topics or themes. This includes identifying the words or phrases most strongly associated with each topic.\n",
    "- Theme Interpretation: the resulting themes are interpreted by examining the most representative words or phrases for each theme. This may involve manually examining the most important words for each theme or using automated techniques to summarize the themes.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's compare LDA with Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), which is based on Truncated SVD (you have learned in the previous session). LSA operates by performing a matrix factorization on a term-document matrix to extract latent semantic features. However, LSA does not explicitly model the generative process of how documents are created or the distribution of topics within documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class='alert alert-block alert-success'>\n",
    "<b>In this session</b>, \n",
    "\n",
    "you will learn about basics of the Topic Modeling. In subsession **D4.1**, we will explain Latent Semantic Analysis and how it is related to Single Value Decomposition, and ypi will execute model on bag-of-words build from news tweets. In **D3.2**, we will show how to implement a Topic Modeling usind Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Moreover, in subsection **D4.3** we will touch uppon assesment and visualisation of learned models.   \n",

    "## D4.1 Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Latent topics** refer to a hidden thematic concept or underlying theme within a collection of documents. It represents a high-level abstract idea or subject that is not explicitly stated but can be inferred from the patterns of word usage within the documents. Latent topics provide a way to group related documents together based on shared content.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dimensionality reduction techniques, such as Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), can help discover topics by reducing the dimensionality of the document-term matrix. LSA utilizes matrix factorization methods, such as Truncated SVD (Singular Value Decomposition), to transform the original high-dimensional space of the document-term matrix into a lower-dimensional space. This reduction allows for the extraction of latent semantic features and the identification of hidden patterns that correspond to different topics. By capturing the most informative components, LSA can reveal the underlying topics in a more compact representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In LSA, documents are represented in a document-term matrix, where each row corresponds to a document and each column represents a unique term in the entire corpus. The matrix contains term frequencies or other term weighting schemes, such as TF-IDF, as the values in the cells. This matrix captures the frequency or importance of each term in each document, providing a numerical representation of the document's content.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='images/Topic_modeling_.svg' >\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "LSA involves a series of four steps, with the second and third being particularly critical and challenging to grasp. The steps are outlined below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Acquire raw Text Data\n",
    "2. Create a document-term matrix\n",
    "3. Apply Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)\n",
    "4. Explore the data encoded with topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first two steps we have learned in the Session C3. Further we will continue with the data produced in that session. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we proceed to carry out the singular value decomposition, which can be achieved by utilizing the truncated SVD model from Scikit-Learn or by utilizing LsiModel from gensim. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Singular value decomposition (SVD)**, a mathematical technique, is employed to condense a large text into a matrix where each row represents unique words and each column represents a document's word counts. This process reduces the number of rows while preserving the general structure of the columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "In mathematics, SVD is a method that factorize any matrix *C* into the product of 3 separate matrices:\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "C = U S V^T\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='images/SVD.svg' >\n",
    "\n",
    "SVD plays a crucial role in reducing dimensionality by selecting the k largest singular values and retaining only the first k columns of the U and V matrices. Here, k represents a hyperparameter that can be adjusted to determine the desired number of topics to extract.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='images/SVD_trunkated.svg' >\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, this can be understood as keeping only the k most significant dimensions in the transformed space.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this context, the matrix *U (m x k)* serves as the term-topic matrix, while the matrix *V (n x k)* represents the document-topic matrix. In both matrices, each column corresponds to one of the k topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "$U$: Rows in this matrix represent term vectors expressed in terms of topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "$V$: Rows in this matrix represent document vectors expressed in terms of topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each row in the $V_k$ matrix (document-topic matrix) represents the vector representation of a specific document. The length of these vectors is equal to k, which corresponds to the desired number of topics. Similarly, the vector representation for terms in the data can be found in the $U_k$ matrix (term-topic matrix).\n",
    "\n",
    "By utilizing SVD, we obtain vector representations for every document and term in our data, with each vector having a length of k. One significant application of these vectors is finding similar words and documents using cosine similarity as a metric. To compare documents, the cosine of the angle formed by any two vectors created from the columns is utilized, along with the dot product of the normalized vectors. A value close to 1 indicates high similarity between documents, while a value close to 0 suggests significant dissimilarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to principal component analysis (PCA), the singular value decomposition allows for encoding the original dataset with these latent features through latent semantic analysis, resulting in a reduction in dimensionality. These latent features correspond to the underlying topics present in the original text data.\n"

    "If we compare these topics to one created with the LSA model, we will see that former model had 6 topics that include word \"trump\" or \"donald_trump\" which drasticly decrease interpretability of the topics. Incontrust, LDA model returns only one topic (*topic 3*) that focuses on mentions of former US president.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following we would like to conclude with the advantages of LDA over LSA: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Probabilistic modeling: LDA is a generative probabilistic model that provides a solid probabilistic framework for understanding the distribution of topics within documents. It models the underlying generative process of how documents are created, assuming a probabilistic distribution of topics. In contrast, LSA is a linear algebra-based technique that lacks a probabilistic interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Topic interpretability: LDA generates a distribution of topics within documents, making it easier to interpret the underlying themes or concepts. Each document is represented as a mixture of topics, and each topic is characterized by a distribution of words. This probabilistic approach allows for more interpretable topics compared to the purely mathematical representations provided by LSA.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Capturing word co-occurrence patterns: LDA captures the patterns of word co-occurrence within documents and across the corpus, which is crucial for capturing the underlying topic structure. It considers the statistical dependencies between words and topics, allowing for more accurate representation of the relationship between words and topics. LSA, on the other hand, primarily focuses on capturing word similarity based on co-occurrence patterns, without explicitly modeling the topic structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Handling of new data: LDA is more flexible when it comes to incorporating new data or updating the model. It supports online learning, which means the model can be incrementally updated with new documents or information. LSA, on the other hand, requires recomputing the matrix decomposition from scratch, making it less suitable for dynamically evolving datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Capture of topic correlations: LDA inherently captures the correlations between topics, allowing for a better understanding of the relationships and dependencies between different topics in the data. It models the topic-topic correlations through the Dirichlet prior, while LSA, being a linear model, does not explicitly model such correlations."

    "\n",
    "Determining the optimal number of topics in a given corpus text can be a challenging task. However, there are several approaches that can be considered to determine the optimal number of topics based on the problem statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first approach involves treating each topic as a separate cluster and assessing the cluster's effectiveness using the Silhouette coefficient. This coefficient provides a measure of how well individual data points fit within their respective clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Another realistic measure for identifying the number of topics is the topic coherence measure. Topic coherence is a widely used metric for evaluating topic models. It utilizes latent variable models, where each generated topic consists of a list of words. In topic coherence, the average or median pairwise word similarity scores for the words within a topic are calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Coherence score** is a measure of how coherent the topics generated by a topic model are, based on the co-occurrence of words in the corpus. The coherence score is typically based on the top N words in each topic, and measures the similarity between pairs of words in the same topic. There are different ways to define the coherence score, but one common approach is to use the Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) between pairs of words.\n",
    "\n",
    "PMI measures the degree of association between two words, based on the probability of their co-occurrence in the corpus relative to their individual probabilities. A high PMI score indicates that the two words are strongly associated and likely to appear together in the same context.\n",
    "\n",
    "The coherence score is calculated as the average PMI score over all pairs of words in each topic, and then averaged over all topics in the model. A higher coherence score indicates that the topics are more coherent and contain more related and meaningful words.\n",
    "Coherence score is often used in combination with perplexity to evaluate the quality of a topic model. Perplexity measures how well the model fits the data, while coherence measures how well the topics generated by the model make sense in terms of the co-occurrence of words in the corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, a topic model can be considered good if it achieves a high value of the topic coherence score. This indicates that the topics generated by the model exhibit a strong coherence and capture meaningful relationships among the words.\n",
    "To assess how good are the topics extracted by the model, we can use different metrics such as the coherence score and perplexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here in this example we will dismiss perplexity score, while recent studies (Krasnov & Sen, 2019; Koltcov et al., 2014) have shown that it on the one hand it does not correlate with human interpretable topics (Chang et al., 2009) and on the other hand it does not have absolute minimum \"and with increasing iterations, it becomes asymptotic\"(Krasnov & Sen, 2019)."

    "### D4.3.3 Visualisation\n",
    "\n",
    "To visualize the results, you can create graphs such as topic-word distributions, word clouds for each topic, or bar charts representing the topic proportions in different documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can explore visually the topics extracted using the python package `pyLDAvis`. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Python library `pyLDAvis` provides a powerful tool for visualizing and interpreting topic models generated using Latent Dirichlet Allocation. With `pyLDAvis`, we can create interactive visualizations that display the topics, the most relevant terms associated with each topic, and the relationships between topics. These visualizations enable us to gain insights into the underlying structure of a corpus of text and to identify patterns and trends that may be difficult to discern through manual analysis alone. Additionally, `pyLDAvis` allows users to customize the visualization parameters and to explore different topic modeling configurations, making it a valuable tool for researchers and data scientists working with large volumes of text data. \n",
    "\n",
    "More in detail, we can visualize topics using the intertopic distance map. The intertopic distance map is a visualization tool in `pyLDAvis` that provides a two-dimensional representation of the distances between topics in a given topic model. The map uses a multidimensional scaling (MDS) algorithm to project the high-dimensional topic space onto a two-dimensional plane, where each point represents a topic and the distance between points reflects the similarity or dissimilarity between topics. The intertopic distance map can help us to identify clusters of related topics and to explore the relationships between different topics in the model. Additionally, the map can be used to highlight potential gaps or overlaps in the topic space, which can be useful for refining the topic model or identifying areas for further investigation. For each topic, we can also visualize the most salient terms.\n",
