    "Data collection is a procedure of gathering information from subjects (all relevant sources), measuring and analyzing accurate insights for research using various techniques. Researchers can evaluate their research questions and hypotheses on the basis of collected data. In most cases, data collection is the primary and most important step for research, irrespective of the field of study. The approach of data collection varies for different fields of study, depending on the required information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Digital behavioral data from the internet is an absolutely massive source of data which we can access by various ways such as connecting APIs (see [Session 3: API harvesting](https://github.com/gesiscss/css_methods_python/blob/main/b_data_collection_methods/3_api_harvesting.ipynb)). In addtion to APIs, web scraping is often the only way we can access data that it is not available in convenient CSV exports or APIs. Websites are often valuable sources of data; for example, weather forecasts, comments on news sites, and posts on forums. To access those sorts of information on webpages, we use web scraping.\n",

    "you will learn how to do web scraping with Python from scratch. In subsession **4.1**, we will have a deep look at the fundamentals of web scraping. You will experience how you can use the Python libraries to handle different data collections. In subsubsession **4.1.1**, you will learn about basics for the feed parsing with the feedparser library, and in subsubsession **4.1.2**, you will learn about html syntax. We move to the basic web scraping tool; the Beautiful soup library in the following subsession **4.2**. In subsession **4.3**, we will introduce the Selenium library to collect data from websites that only load content once you interact with it (scrolling, clicking, etc.) and are difficult to obtain through more traditional scraping approaches. We will work through an actual web scraping projects throughout this session, focusing on Wikipedia pages, online news sites, pdf pages, and Quora. Finally, in subsession **4.4**, we will compare these libraries and talk about the challanges and data privacy approaches.\n",

    "While web scraping is one of the common ways of collecting data from websites, a lot of websites offer APIs to access the public data that they host on their website. This is to avoid unnecessary traffic on the websites.

    "According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_feed), a web feed (or news feed) is a data format used for providing users with frequently updated content. Content distributors syndicate a web feed, thereby allowing users to subscribe a channel to it by adding the feed resource address to a news aggregator client (also called a feed reader or a news reader). Users typically subscribe to a feed by manually entering the URL of a feed or clicking a link in a web browser or by dragging the link from the web browser to the aggregator, thus \"RSS and Atom files provide news updates from a website in a simple form for your computer.\"\n",

Viswanathan came the day before his interview for an employment visa.\\n\\n\\n\"I came here to pray for my brother\\'s U.K. visa 10 years ago and for my wife\\'s U.S. visa two years ago,\" he said. \"They were both successful. So I have faith.\"\\n\\n\\nThe Sri Lakshmi Visa Ganapathy Temple is a few miles north of the airport in Chennai (formerly Madras), a bustling metropolis on the Coromandel Coast in southeast India -- known for its iconic cuisine, ancient temples and churches, silk saris, classical music, dance and sculptures.\\n\\n\\nThis \"visa temple\" has surged in popularity among U.S. visa seekers over the past decade; they can be found in almost any Indian city with a U.S. consulate. They typically gain a following through word of mouth or social media.\\n\\n\\nA mile away from the Ganesh temple is the Sri Lakshmi Narasimha Navaneetha Krishnan Temple, where an idol of Hanuman – a deity who has a human body and the face of a monkey — is believed to possess the power to secure visas. Also known as \"Anjaneya,\" this god stands for strength, wisdom and devotion. In this temple, he has earned the monikers \"America Anjaneya\" and \"Visa Anjaneya.\"\\n\\n\\nThe temple\\'s longtime secretary, G.C. Srinivasan, said it wasn\\'t until 2016 that this temple became a \"visa temple.\"\\n\\n\\n\"It was around that time that a few people who prayed for a visa spread the word around that they were successful, and it\\'s continued,\" he said.\\n\\n\\nA month ago, Srinivasan said he met someone who got news of his visa approval even as as he was circumambulating the Anjaneya idol — a common Hindu practice of walking around a sacred object or site.\\n\\n\\nOn a recent Saturday night, devotees decorated the idol with garlands made of betel leaves. S. Pradeep, who placed a garland on the deity, said he was not there to pray for a visa, but believes in the god\\'s unique power.\\n\\n\\n\"He is my favorite god,\" he said. \"If you genuinely pray – not just for visa – it will come true.\"\\n\\n\\nAt the Ganesh temple, some devotees had success stories to share. Jyothi Bontha said her visa interview at the U.S. Consulate in Chennai went without a hitch, and that she had returned to offer thanks.\\n\\n\\n\"They barely asked me a couple of questions,\" she said. \"I was pleasantly surprised.\"\\xa0\\n\\n\\nBontha\\'s friend, Phani Veeranki, stood nearby, nervously clutching an envelope containing her visa application and supporting documents. Bontha and Veeranki, both computer science students from the neighboring state of Andhra Pradesh and childhood friends, are headed to Ohio.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBoth learned about the visa temple on the social media platform Telegram.\\n\\n\\nVeeranki said she was anxious because she had a lot riding on her upcoming visa interview.\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'m the first person in my family to go the United States,\" she said. \"My mother is afraid to send me. But I\\'m excited for the opportunities I\\'ll have in America.\"\\n\\n\\nVeeranki then handed over the envelope to the temple\\'s priest for him to place at the foot of the idol for a blessing.\\n\\n\\n\"We\\'ve been hearing about applications being rejected,\" she said, her hands still folded in prayer. \"I\\'m really hoping mine gets approved.\"\\n\\n\\nIf she and Bontha make it to Ohio, they want to take a trip to Niagara Falls.\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'ve always wanted to see it,\" Bontha said.\\n\\n\\nMohanbabu Jagannathan and his wife, Sangeetha, run the temple, which Jagannathan\\'s grandfather built in 1987. Their house is on a cul-de-sac, which is considered bad luck in several Asian cultures. In Chennai, it is common to find a Ganesh temple outside cul-de-sac homes due to the belief that the deity has the power to ward off evil. At first, only neighbors came to the temple, Jagannathan said.\\n\\n\\n\"But over the years it started earning a quirky reputation,\" he said. \"A lot of visa applicants who came to the temple spread the word that they found success after praying here.\"\\n\\n\\nIn 2009, his father, Jagannathan Radhakrishnan, reconstructed the temple and added the word \"visa\" to the temple\\'s name. Jagannathan said the success stories are heartwarming; visitors sometimes stop by his home to thank his family for keeping the temple open.\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'ve never been bothered by it,\" Jagannathan said. \"We offer this as a service to the public. It\\'s a joy to see how happy people are when they come back and tell us they got their visa.\"\\n\\n\\nHis wife said she was touched by the story of a man who came all the way from New Delhi to pray for a visa to see his grandchild after eight years apart. She remembers another time when a woman called her in tears, saying her visa application was rejected.\\n\\n\\n\"Sure, some don\\'t get it,\" she said. \"God only knows why.\"\\n\\n\\nPadma Kannan brought her daughter, Monisha, who is preparing to pursue a master\\'s degree in marketing analytics at Clark University. Kannan believes her daughter got her visa because of this powerful deity.\\n\\n\\n\"I found this temple on Google,\" she said. \"I was so nervous for her, and so I prayed here.\"\\n\\n\\nMonisha Kannan said she is not so sure she got her visa because of this temple, but she said she came to support her mom.\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'m skeptical,\" she said. \"I\\'m just someone who goes with the flow.\"\\n\\n\\nHer mother takes a more philosophical stance.\\n\\n\\n\"We pray for our children and things happen easily for them,\" she said. \"I think when they go through the rigors of life themselves, they will start believing in the power of prayer.\"\\n\\n\\nViswanathan said he is not someone \"who usually believes in such things.\" When his brother got his British visa a decade ago after offering prayers here, Viswanathan chalked it up to coincidence. He became a believer when his wife got her U.S. visa two years ago, he said.\\n\\n\\nThe day after he visited the temple this time, Viswanathan\\'s employment visa was approved. He\\'ll head to New Hampshire in a few months.\\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s all about faith,\" he said. \"If you believe it will happen, it will happen.\"',\n",

Srinivasan, said it wasn\\'t until 2016 that this temple became a \"visa temple.\"\\n\\n\\n\"It was around that time that a few people who prayed for a visa spread the word around that they were successful, and it\\'s continued,\" he said.\\n\\n\\nA month ago, Srinivasan said he met someone who got news of his visa approval even as as he was circumambulating the Anjaneya idol — a common Hindu practice of walking around a sacred object or site.\\n\\n\\nOn a recent Saturday night, devotees decorated the idol with garlands made of betel leaves. S. Pradeep, who placed a garland on the deity, said he was not there to pray for a visa, but believes in the god\\'s unique power.\\n\\n\\n\"He is my favorite god,\" he said. \"If you genuinely pray – not just for visa – it will come true.\"\\n\\n\\nAt the Ganesh temple, some devotees had success stories to share. Jyothi Bontha said her visa interview at the U.S. Consulate in Chennai went without a hitch, and that she had returned to offer thanks.\\n\\n\\n\"They barely asked me a couple of questions,\" she said. \"I was pleasantly surprised.\"\\xa0\\n\\n\\nBontha\\'s friend, Phani Veeranki, stood nearby, nervously clutching an envelope containing her visa application and supporting documents. Bontha and Veeranki, both computer science students from the neighboring state of Andhra Pradesh and childhood friends, are headed to Ohio.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBoth learned about the visa temple on the social media platform Telegram.\\n\\n\\nVeeranki said she was anxious because she had a lot riding on her upcoming visa interview.\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'m the first person in my family to go the United States,\" she said. \"My mother is afraid to send me. But I\\'m excited for the opportunities I\\'ll have in America.\"\\n\\n\\nVeeranki then handed over the envelope to the temple\\'s priest for him to place at the foot of the idol for a blessing.\\n\\n\\n\"We\\'ve been hearing about applications being rejected,\" she said, her hands still folded in prayer. \"I\\'m really hoping mine gets approved.\"\\n\\n\\nIf she and Bontha make it to Ohio, they want to take a trip to Niagara Falls.\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'ve always wanted to see it,\" Bontha said.\\n\\n\\nMohanbabu Jagannathan and his wife, Sangeetha, run the temple, which Jagannathan\\'s grandfather built in 1987. Their house is on a cul-de-sac, which is considered bad luck in several Asian cultures. In Chennai, it is common to find a Ganesh temple outside cul-de-sac homes due to the belief that the deity has the power to ward off evil. At first, only neighbors came to the temple, Jagannathan said.\\n\\n\\n\"But over the years it started earning a quirky reputation,\" he said. \"A lot of visa applicants who came to the temple spread the word that they found success after praying here.\"\\n\\n\\nIn 2009, his father, Jagannathan Radhakrishnan, reconstructed the temple and added the word \"visa\" to the temple\\'s name. Jagannathan said the success stories are heartwarming; visitors sometimes stop by his home to thank his family for keeping the temple open.\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'ve never been bothered by it,\" Jagannathan said. \"We offer this as a service to the public. It\\'s a joy to see how happy people are when they come back and tell us they got their visa.\"\\n\\n\\nHis wife said she was touched by the story of a man who came all the way from New Delhi to pray for a visa to see his grandchild after eight years apart. She remembers another time when a woman called her in tears, saying her visa application was rejected.\\n\\n\\n\"Sure, some don\\'t get it,\" she said. \"God only knows why.\"\\n\\n\\nPadma Kannan brought her daughter, Monisha, who is preparing to pursue a master\\'s degree in marketing analytics at Clark University. Kannan believes her daughter got her visa because of this powerful deity.\\n\\n\\n\"I found this temple on Google,\" she said. \"I was so nervous for her, and so I prayed here.\"\\n\\n\\nMonisha Kannan said she is not so sure she got her visa because of this temple, but she said she came to support her mom.\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'m skeptical,\" she said. \"I\\'m just someone who goes with the flow.\"\\n\\n\\nHer mother takes a more philosophical stance.\\n\\n\\n\"We pray for our children and things happen easily for them,\" she said. \"I think when they go through the rigors of life themselves, they will start believing in the power of prayer.\"\\n\\n\\nViswanathan said he is not someone \"who usually believes in such things.\" When his brother got his British visa a decade ago after offering prayers here, Viswanathan chalked it up to coincidence. He became a believer when his wife got her U.S. visa two years ago, he said.\\n\\n\\nThe day after he visited the temple this time, Viswanathan\\'s employment visa was approved. He\\'ll head to New Hampshire in a few months.\\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s all about faith,\" he said. \"If you believe it will happen, it will happen.\"'},\n",

Republican-led states filed an appeal asking the court to keep it in place. The Biden administration also has challenged parts of the ruling ending the Trump-era asylum restrictions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn a detailed assessment ahead of the guideline shift, the DHS said the agency is already executing plans to manage an increased flow of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border, including the use of expedited removal under the Title 8 authority.\\n\\n\\n“Among other things, Title 8 provides that individuals who cross the border without legal authorization are processed for removal and, if unable to establish a legal basis to remain in the United States, promptly removed from the country,” according to DHS.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile both parties wait for the judge\\'s decision, migrant advocates in Reynosa, Mexico, told VOA that about 750 migrants a day have arrived in the last few days.\\n\\n\\nHector Silva, a pastor in the area who also operates one of the largest migrant shelters south of the border, Senda de Vida, or \"Path of Life,” told VOA that advocates and volunteers have been helping about 14,000 families in the last few weeks.\\n\\n\\n“We have seen in past years that people get encouraged to come and then they do not know where to go,\" Silva said in Spanish. \"And what is happening right now from Tijuana to Matamoros is that people are waiting, and they have been waiting for months.

Lisa Schlein reports for VOA from Geneva.\\n\\n\\nKenya Concerned by Cholera, Measles Outbreaks at Congested Refugee Camp\\n\\n\\nAid groups say measles and cholera outbreaks at Kenya\\'s congested Dadaab refugee camp have killed at least five people and sickened more than 400. The outbreaks come as thousands of Somalis have been arriving at the camp this year to escape record drought back home, stretching camp resources. Juma Majanga reports from Dadaab refugee camp in northeast Kenya. Editor\\'s note: The video has been updated to correct the timeline of the arrival of more than 80,000 Somalis.\\n\\n\\nNews Brief\\n\\n\\n— U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) released data showing 1,023,200 naturalizations in fiscal 2022, the highest number of citizens the agency has naturalized since 2008.'},\n",

       "   'summary': 'The Supreme Court on Tuesday wrestled with a politically tinged dispute over a Biden administration policy that would prioritize deportation of people in the country illegally who pose the greatest public safety risk.\\n\\n\\nIt was not clear after arguments that stretched past two hours and turned highly contentious at times whether the justices would allow the policy to take effect, or side with Republican-led states that have so far succeeded in blocking it.\\n\\n\\nAt the center of the case is a September 2021 directive from the Department of Homeland Security that paused deportations unless individuals had committed acts of terrorism, espionage or \"egregious threats to public safety.\" The guidance, issued after Joe Biden became president, updated a Trump-era policy that removed people in the country illegally regardless of criminal history or community ties.\\n\\n\\nOn Tuesday, the administration\\'s top Supreme Court lawyer told the justices that federal law does \"not create an unyielding mandate to apprehend and remove\" every one of the more than 11 million immigrants living in the country illegally.\\n\\n\\nSolicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar said it would be \"incredibly destabilizing on the ground\" for the high court to require that. Congress has not given DHS enough money to vastly increase the number of people it holds and deports, the Biden administration has said.\\n\\n\\nBut Texas Solicitor General Judd Stone told the court the administration is violating federal law that requires the detention and deportation of people who are in the U.S. illegally and who have been convicted of any serious crime, not just the most serious, specifically defined ones.\\n\\n\\nChief Justice John Roberts was among the conservative justices who pushed back strongly on the Biden administration\\'s arguments.\\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s our job to say what the law is, not whether or not it can be possibly implemented or whether there are difficulties there, and I don\\'t think we should change that responsibility just because Congress and the executive can\\'t agree on something. ... I don\\'t think we should let them off the hook,\" he said.\\n\\n\\nYet Roberts, in questioning Stone, also called Prelogar\\'s argument compelling.\\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s impossible for the executive to do what you want it to do, right?\" Roberts asked.\\n\\n\\nRoberts wasn\\'t totally satisfied when Stone said the number of people potentially affected total 60,000 to 80,000.\\n\\n\\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh said that whatever the actual number, \"the resources still aren\\'t there.\"\\n\\n\\nThe court\\'s three liberal justices, on the other hand, were sympathetic to the Biden administration\\'s arguments. Justice Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, made clear they believed that Texas and Louisiana, which joined Texas in suing over the directive, weren\\'t even entitled to bring their case.\\n\\n\\nThe case is the latest example of a Republican litigation strategy that has succeeded in slowing Biden administration initiatives by going to GOP-friendly courts. Kagan picked up on that during arguments, saying that Texas could file its suit in a courthouse where it was guaranteed to get a sympathetic hearing and that one judge stopped \"a federal immigration policy in its tracks.\"\\n\\n\\nIn a separate ongoing legal dispute, three judges chosen by then-President Donald Trump are among the four Republican-appointed judges who have so far prevented the administration\\'s student loan cancellation program from taking effect.\\n\\n\\nThe states said they would face added costs of having to detain people the federal government might allow to remain free inside the United States, despite their criminal records.\\n\\n\\nFederal appeals courts had reached conflicting decisions over DHS guidance.\\n\\n\\nThe federal appeals court in Cincinnati earlier overturned a district judge\\'s order that put the policy on hold in a lawsuit filed by Arizona, Ohio and Montana.\\n\\n\\nBut in the separate suit filed by Texas and Louisiana, a federal judge in Texas ordered a nationwide halt to the guidance and a federal appellate panel in New Orleans declined to step in.\\n\\n\\nIn July, the court voted 5-4 to leave the immigration policy frozen nationwide. Conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett joined the court\\'s three liberals in saying they would have allowed the Biden administration to put in place the guidance.\\n\\n\\nAt the same time, the court said it would hear arguments in the case in late November.\\n\\n\\nThe justices have several questions to sort through, whether the states should have been permitted to file their challenge in the first place, whether the policy violates immigration law and, if it does, whether it was appropriate for the Texas-based judge to block it.\\n\\n\\nOn that last point, Prelogar said the judge\\'s decision to \"vacate\" the policy was wrong, and her argument questioned whether judges have been getting it all wrong for decades.\\n\\n\\nThe issue touched a nerve, especially among Roberts, Kavanaugh and Ketanji Brown Jackson, the justices who once served on the federal appeals court in Washington that regularly vacates policies it determines are unlawful.\\n\\n\\n\"Fairly radical,\" Roberts said. \"Pretty astonishing,\" Kavanaugh said. Jackson, more restrained, also questioned Prelogar\\'s reasoning.\\n\\n\\n\"There seems to be a kind of D.C. Circuit cartel,\" Kagan joked.\\n\\n\\nA decision in U.S. v. Texas, 22-58, is expected by late June.',\n",

Conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett joined the court\\'s three liberals in saying they would have allowed the Biden administration to put in place the guidance.\\n\\n\\nAt the same time, the court said it would hear arguments in the case in late November.\\n\\n\\nThe justices have several questions to sort through, whether the states should have been permitted to file their challenge in the first place, whether the policy violates immigration law and, if it does, whether it was appropriate for the Texas-based judge to block it.\\n\\n\\nOn that last point, Prelogar said the judge\\'s decision to \"vacate\" the policy was wrong, and her argument questioned whether judges have been getting it all wrong for decades.\\n\\n\\nThe issue touched a nerve, especially among Roberts, Kavanaugh and Ketanji Brown Jackson, the justices who once served on the federal appeals court in Washington that regularly vacates policies it determines are unlawful.\\n\\n\\n\"Fairly radical,\" Roberts said. \"Pretty astonishing,\" Kavanaugh said. Jackson, more restrained, also questioned Prelogar\\'s reasoning.\\n\\n\\n\"There seems to be a kind of D.C. Circuit cartel,\" Kagan joked.\\n\\n\\nA decision in U.S. v. Texas, 22-58, is expected by late June.'},\n",

       "   'summary': \"From refugees to elected office, 14 Somali Americans have won legislative seats across the U.S. this year. Some also have been elected to city councils, school boards and the boards of parks and recreation in their respective cities. The U.S. midterm elections have proved to be historic for Somalis, with more women elected to public offices than ever before.\\n\\n\\nVOA Somali Service’s Torch Program explains how Somalis who arrived as migrants and refugees to the West have made their way into politics.\\n\\n\\nHashi Shafi, executive director of the Somali Action Alliance, a Minneapolis-based community organization in the northern U.S. state of Minnesota, says the campaign that led Somalis to shine in U.S. politics started right after 9/11 with a community-based voter registration program.\\n\\n\\n“In the beginning, Somalis were thinking about returning back to Somalia. They had their luggage ready; the artists were singing with songs giving the community a hope of immediate returning, but after 9/11, the community activists realized that such a dream was not realistic, and the Somalis needed to find a way to melt into the pot. Then, we started registering community members to encourage them to vote,” Shafi said. “Somali Americans’ rise in political power has come with its difficulties.”\\n\\n\\nTight-knit community\\n\\n\\nAbdirahman Sharif, the imam and the leader of the Dar-Al-Hijrah Mosque in Minneapolis says another reason Somalis have risen in U.S. politics is because they are a tight-knit community.\\n\\n\\n“When Somalis came to [the] U.S., they moved to a foreign country where they could not communicate with people. So, for them, being close to people from their country meant having someone to communicate with and that helped them to unite their votes, and resources for political aspirants,” Sharif said.\\n\\n\\nThe state of Minnesota has the largest Somali community in the country, mostly in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area. According to U.N. estimates from 2015, there are about 150,000 Somalis, both refugees and nonrefugees, living in the U.S.\\n\\n\\nThe first wave of Somalis came to Minnesota in early 1990s after civil war broke out in their country. Another wave of refugees followed, and the community thrived, thanks to the state's welcoming social programs. It's the biggest Somali community in North America, possibly in the world outside of East Africa.\\n\\n\\nSimilarly, job opportunities and a relatively low cost of living have drawn Somali immigrants to Columbus, Ohio. Ohio has the second largest Somali population in the United States, with an estimated 45,000 immigrants.\\n\\n\\nCommunities have grown significantly in both states. Somali-owned restaurants, mosques, clothing stores, coffee shops and other businesses have opened in several neighborhoods in Minneapolis, called Little Mogadishu, named after Somalia's capital.\\n\\n\\nLarge communities of Somalis are also concentrated in Lewiston and Portland, Maine, as well as Seattle in Washington state, and the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area.\\n\\n\\nAnalyst Abdi-Qafar Abdi Wardere says such concentrations have helped Somalis to gather their strength as a community.\\n\\n\\n“Somalis are bound together by intimate social or cultural ties that helped them to live together and concentrate [in] certain states or neighborhoods in the diaspora. About one-third of Minnesota's Somali residents came directly from refugee camps; others settled first in another state and then relocated to Minnesota. I can say they are somehow a tight-knit community,” Wardere said.\\n\\n\\nCanada and Europe\\n\\n\\nIt’s not only in the United States but Somali immigrants have also found their place in Canadian and European politics. They have gathered in big numbers in major cities to have an impact and exert influence.\\n\\n\\nIn Toronto, Canada, Somalis have made breakthroughs by winning elections and political offices. Ahmed Hussen, a lawyer and community activist born and raised in Somalia, is among the most influential Somalis in Canada. He was first elected as a member of parliament in 2015 to represent York South - Weston. He has previously served as minister of families, children and social development, and minister of immigration, refugees and citizenship. Now he is Canada’s minister of housing, diversity and inclusion.\\n\\n\\nFaisal Ahmed Hassan, who is a Somali Canadian politician, was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 2018 until his defeat in 2022. He thinks for Somalis in the diaspora, there are two reasons they run for political office.\\n\\n\\n“One reason is that the community wants someone to represent their new homes and second is that Somalis inspire one another to doing something. If one of them does something good, others are encouraged that they can do the same,” Hassan said.\\n\\n\\nIn the Nordic region of Europe, the first Somalis arrived in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Later, as Somalia's civil war became more intense, new arrivals joined.\\n\\n\\nIn recent years, the first generation of Somali refugees has been making its mark in politics, from the local council level to the national stage.\\n\\n\\nIn Finland, Suldaan Said Ahmed has been the first Somali-born member of the Finnish parliament since 2021 and he is also the country’s special representative on peace mediation in the Horn of Africa, the northeastern region, where Somalia is located.\\n\\n\\nIn Sweden, Leila Ali Elmi, a former Somali refugee, made history in 2018 becoming the first Somali-Swedish Muslim woman elected to the Swedish parliament.\\n\\n\\nLast year, Marian Abdi Hussein became the first Somali MP in Norway’s history.\\n\\n\\nBoth women also became the first Muslims to wear hijabs in their respect houses of parliament.\\n\\n\\nIn Britain, Magid Magid, a Somali-British activist and politician who served as the mayor of Sheffield from May 2018 to May 2019, became the first Somali elected to the European Parliament.\\n\\n\\nMohamed Gure, a former member of the council of the city of Borlänge, Sweden, said there are unique things that keep Somalis together and make them successful in the politics in Europe.\\n\\n\\n“The fabric of Somalis is unique compared to the other diaspora communities. They share the same ethnicity, color, language, and religion. There are many things that keep them together that divide them back home. So, their togetherness is one reason I can attribute to their successes,” Gure said.\\n\\n\\nGure says the fear of migrants and refugees stoked by politicians has been setting a defining narrative for elections in the West.\\n\\n\\n“One other reason is the fear of a growing number of migrants and refugees in the West. As they are trying to melt into the pot, such fear created by nationalist politicians continues to set a tone for electoral victories that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago,” Gure said.\",\n",

According to U.N. estimates from 2015, there are about 150,000 Somalis, both refugees and nonrefugees, living in the U.S.\\n\\n\\nThe first wave of Somalis came to Minnesota in early 1990s after civil war broke out in their country. Another wave of refugees followed, and the community thrived, thanks to the state's welcoming social programs. It's the biggest Somali community in North America, possibly in the world outside of East Africa.\\n\\n\\nSimilarly, job opportunities and a relatively low cost of living have drawn Somali immigrants to Columbus, Ohio. Ohio has the second largest Somali population in the United States, with an estimated 45,000 immigrants.\\n\\n\\nCommunities have grown significantly in both states. Somali-owned restaurants, mosques, clothing stores, coffee shops and other businesses have opened in several neighborhoods in Minneapolis, called Little Mogadishu, named after Somalia's capital.\\n\\n\\nLarge communities of Somalis are also concentrated in Lewiston and Portland, Maine, as well as Seattle in Washington state, and the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area.\\n\\n\\nAnalyst Abdi-Qafar Abdi Wardere says such concentrations have helped Somalis to gather their strength as a community.\\n\\n\\n“Somalis are bound together by intimate social or cultural ties that helped them to live together and concentrate [in] certain states or neighborhoods in the diaspora. About one-third of Minnesota's Somali residents came directly from refugee camps; others settled first in another state and then relocated to Minnesota. I can say they are somehow a tight-knit community,” Wardere said.\\n\\n\\nCanada and Europe\\n\\n\\nIt’s not only in the United States but Somali immigrants have also found their place in Canadian and European politics. They have gathered in big numbers in major cities to have an impact and exert influence.\\n\\n\\nIn Toronto, Canada, Somalis have made breakthroughs by winning elections and political offices. Ahmed Hussen, a lawyer and community activist born and raised in Somalia, is among the most influential Somalis in Canada. He was first elected as a member of parliament in 2015 to represent York South - Weston. He has previously served as minister of families, children and social development, and minister of immigration, refugees and citizenship. Now he is Canada’s minister of housing, diversity and inclusion.\\n\\n\\nFaisal Ahmed Hassan, who is a Somali Canadian politician, was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 2018 until his defeat in 2022. He thinks for Somalis in the diaspora, there are two reasons they run for political office.\\n\\n\\n“One reason is that the community wants someone to represent their new homes and second is that Somalis inspire one another to doing something. If one of them does something good, others are encouraged that they can do the same,” Hassan said.\\n\\n\\nIn the Nordic region of Europe, the first Somalis arrived in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Later, as Somalia's civil war became more intense, new arrivals joined.\\n\\n\\nIn recent years, the first generation of Somali refugees has been making its mark in politics, from the local council level to the national stage.\\n\\n\\nIn Finland, Suldaan Said Ahmed has been the first Somali-born member of the Finnish parliament since 2021 and he is also the country’s special representative on peace mediation in the Horn of Africa, the northeastern region, where Somalia is located.\\n\\n\\nIn Sweden, Leila Ali Elmi, a former Somali refugee, made history in 2018 becoming the first Somali-Swedish Muslim woman elected to the Swedish parliament.\\n\\n\\nLast year, Marian Abdi Hussein became the first Somali MP in Norway’s history.\\n\\n\\nBoth women also became the first Muslims to wear hijabs in their respect houses of parliament.\\n\\n\\nIn Britain, Magid Magid, a Somali-British activist and politician who served as the mayor of Sheffield from May 2018 to May 2019, became the first Somali elected to the European Parliament.\\n\\n\\nMohamed Gure, a former member of the council of the city of Borlänge, Sweden, said there are unique things that keep Somalis together and make them successful in the politics in Europe.\\n\\n\\n“The fabric of Somalis is unique compared to the other diaspora communities. They share the same ethnicity, color, language, and religion. There are many things that keep them together that divide them back home. So, their togetherness is one reason I can attribute to their successes,” Gure said.\\n\\n\\nGure says the fear of migrants and refugees stoked by politicians has been setting a defining narrative for elections in the West.\\n\\n\\n“One other reason is the fear of a growing number of migrants and refugees in the West. As they are trying to melt into the pot, such fear created by nationalist politicians continues to set a tone for electoral victories that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago,” Gure said.\"},\n",

Republican-led states filed an appeal asking the court to keep it in place. The Biden administration also has challenged parts of the ruling ending the Trump-era asylum restrictions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn a detailed assessment ahead of the guideline shift, the DHS said the agency is already executing plans to manage an increased flow of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border, including the use of expedited removal under the Title 8 authority.\\n\\n\\n“Among other things, Title 8 provides that individuals who cross the border without legal authorization are processed for removal and, if unable to establish a legal basis to remain in the United States, promptly removed from the country,” according to DHS.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile both parties wait for the judge\\'s decision, migrant advocates in Reynosa, Mexico, told VOA that about 750 migrants a day have arrived in the last few days.\\n\\n\\nHector Silva, a pastor in the area who also operates one of the largest migrant shelters south of the border, Senda de Vida, or \"Path of Life,” told VOA that advocates and volunteers have been helping about 14,000 families in the last few weeks.\\n\\n\\n“We have seen in past years that people get encouraged to come and then they do not know where to go,\" Silva said in Spanish. \"And what is happening right now from Tijuana to Matamoros is that people are waiting, and they have been waiting for months. [Some] have been waiting for years. And we tell them one thing: do not risk yourselves. Do not come without knowing what you will face at the border.”\\xa0\\n\\n\\nAccording to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) in the Rio Grande Valley sector, about 1,800 migrants turned themselves in to authorities during a 48-hour period after crossing from Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, to El Paso, Texas, indicating that a considerable number of people who were already in Ciudad Juarez joined the new arrivals to cross the border together.\\n\\n\\nMarco Antonio Diaz, from Honduras, is one of those people. Sitting on a dirt road along with his pregnant wife and small child, Diaz told VOA that lifting the health order gives them hope and courage.\\n\\n\\n“The truth is that it makes us happy because we want to cross to the other side to work,\" he said.\\n\\n\\nDíaz, his family, along with elderly people, people with disabilities, and other children, have slept in tents, and because of heavy rains in the region in the past few days, have endured low temperatures.\\n\\n\\n\"It has rained a lot,\" he said \"There was a night that it rained so much that we got very wet and very cold.”\\n\\n\\nThe seven-page preparedness update released by the DHS this week takes note of the agency’s successes, which include faster processing for migrants in custody at the southern border, an increase in staff, more criminal prosecutions of smugglers, and more temporary detention tents.\\n\\n\\nHowever, the update does not mention any major changes in how the agency will deal with large numbers of migrants entering the country to ask for asylum.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nSince March 2020, U.S. border authorities have used Title 42 to deny entry to millions of would-be asylum seekers on the basis that allowing them in could increase the spread of COVID-19.\\n\\n\\nPer CBP data, Title 42 has been used in most of the estimated 2.38 million encounters with migrants in fiscal year 2022.\\n\\n\\nThe data indicate that 1,079,507 were expelled and 1,299,437 were processed under Title 8 authority.\\n\\n\\nNot every encounter is a unique apprehension, as some migrants have tried to cross multiple times.\\n\\n\\nIn various reports, U.S. border officials and immigration advocates say border numbers reflect economic deterioration and political conditions in some countries driving people to make their way to the southern U.S. border.\\n\\n\\nIn fiscal year 2023, which began October 1, U.S. border officials registered 230,678 migrant encounters. Of those, 78,477 were expelled. The rest were either detained, allowed to seek asylum, paroled, or swiftly deported under expedited removal.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nEfforts to end Title 42\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe Biden administration first attempted to end Title 42 in May, but efforts were stopped when Republican-led states sued and a federal court in Louisiana preliminarily agreed with the states.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe U.S. Department of Justice then filed an appeal and argued the Biden administration’s decision to lift the regulation was legal.\\n\\n\\nThe Louisiana federal judge said in his ruling that not only had the Biden administration violated administrative procedure laws, but also that ending Title 42 would cause “irreparable harm” since the Republican-led states were expected to spend resources on law enforcement, education, and other services to assist newly arrived migrants.\\n\\n\\nStill, federal law allows people from other countries to seek asylum in the United States if they fear persecution at home based on race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn a statement after the ruling, the DHS said Title 42 is not an immigration control tool but a public health order, but that it “will comply with the court’s order to continue enforcing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Title 42 Order as long as it remains in place.”\\n\\n\\nAt the time, Luis Miranda, a CBP spokesperson, told VOA that officials were preparing to \"simply go back to processing any encounters across the border the way we always have under Title 8, which is the immigration authority that has always been in place throughout the history of U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\"\\n\\n\\nMiranda said the U.S. government was expecting arrivals to increase at the southern border but added that those unable to establish a legal basis to remain in the United States will be removed.\\n\\n\\n\"We\\'ve been planning for that. … And to process any encounters effectively, and humanely. But ultimately, if someone is trying to come in without legal authorization and doesn\\'t have the legal basis to stay, they will be placed in removal proceedings,\" he said.\\n\\n\\nVOA contacted CBP officials for an update, but as of Thursday morning had not received a reply.',\n",

Sitting on a dirt road along with his pregnant wife and small child, Diaz told VOA that lifting the health order gives them hope and courage.\\n\\n\\n“The truth is that it makes us happy because we want to cross to the other side to work,\" he said.\\n\\n\\nDíaz, his family, along with elderly people, people with disabilities, and other children, have slept in tents, and because of heavy rains in the region in the past few days, have endured low temperatures.\\n\\n\\n\"It has rained a lot,\" he said \"There was a night that it rained so much that we got very wet and very cold.”\\n\\n\\nThe seven-page preparedness update released by the DHS this week takes note of the agency’s successes, which include faster processing for migrants in custody at the southern border, an increase in staff, more criminal prosecutions of smugglers, and more temporary detention tents.\\n\\n\\nHowever, the update does not mention any major changes in how the agency will deal with large numbers of migrants entering the country to ask for asylum.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nSince March 2020, U.S. border authorities have used Title 42 to deny entry to millions of would-be asylum seekers on the basis that allowing them in could increase the spread of COVID-19.\\n\\n\\nPer CBP data, Title 42 has been used in most of the estimated 2.38 million encounters with migrants in fiscal year 2022.\\n\\n\\nThe data indicate that 1,079,507 were expelled and 1,299,437 were processed under Title 8 authority.\\n\\n\\nNot every encounter is a unique apprehension, as some migrants have tried to cross multiple times.\\n\\n\\nIn various reports, U.S. border officials and immigration advocates say border numbers reflect economic deterioration and political conditions in some countries driving people to make their way to the southern U.S. border.\\n\\n\\nIn fiscal year 2023, which began October 1, U.S. border officials registered 230,678 migrant encounters. Of those, 78,477 were expelled. The rest were either detained, allowed to seek asylum, paroled, or swiftly deported under expedited removal.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nEfforts to end Title 42\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe Biden administration first attempted to end Title 42 in May, but efforts were stopped when Republican-led states sued and a federal court in Louisiana preliminarily agreed with the states.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe U.S. Department of Justice then filed an appeal and argued the Biden administration’s decision to lift the regulation was legal.\\n\\n\\nThe Louisiana federal judge said in his ruling that not only had the Biden administration violated administrative procedure laws, but also that ending Title 42 would cause “irreparable harm” since the Republican-led states were expected to spend resources on law enforcement, education, and other services to assist newly arrived migrants.\\n\\n\\nStill, federal law allows people from other countries to seek asylum in the United States if they fear persecution at home based on race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn a statement after the ruling, the DHS said Title 42 is not an immigration control tool but a public health order, but that it “will comply with the court’s order to continue enforcing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Title 42 Order as long as it remains in place.”\\n\\n\\nAt the time, Luis Miranda, a CBP spokesperson, told VOA that officials were preparing to \"simply go back to processing any encounters across the border the way we always have under Title 8, which is the immigration authority that has always been in place throughout the history of U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\"\\n\\n\\nMiranda said the U.S. government was expecting arrivals to increase at the southern border but added that those unable to establish a legal basis to remain in the United States will be removed.\\n\\n\\n\"We\\'ve been planning for that. … And to process any encounters effectively, and humanely. But ultimately, if someone is trying to come in without legal authorization and doesn\\'t have the legal basis to stay, they will be placed in removal proceedings,\" he said.\\n\\n\\nVOA contacted CBP officials for an update, but as of Thursday morning had not received a reply.'},\n",

TPS status can be renewed, depending on the circumstances of the home country.\\n\\n\\nTo be eligible for TPS under Ethiopia’s designation, individuals must demonstrate their continuous residence in the United States since Oct. 20, 2022, and continuous physical presence in the United States since Dec. 12, 2022, according to the DHS. Individuals arriving in the United States after Oct. 20, 2022, are not eligible for TPS under this designation.\\n\\n\\nDHS said about 26,700 Ethiopians in the United States are eligible to file applications for TPS.\\n\\n\\nAccording to the U.S. Census, about 272,000 people in the United States came from Ethiopia.\\n\\n\\nThe TPS plan is poised to go into effect even as basic services like electricity and telecoms have been restored to key parts of Ethiopia’s Tigray region following the signing of a cease-fire deal a month ago, halting hostilities in nearly two years of war but most areas are still cut off from the world.\\n\\n\\nInformation for this story came from the Agence France-Presse and The Associated Press.'},\n",

       "  'summary': \"From refugees to elected office, 14 Somali Americans have won legislative seats across the U.S. this year. Some also have been elected to city councils, school boards and the boards of parks and recreation in their respective cities. The U.S. midterm elections have proved to be historic for Somalis, with more women elected to public offices than ever before.\\n\\n\\nVOA Somali Service’s Torch Program explains how Somalis who arrived as migrants and refugees to the West have made their way into politics.\\n\\n\\nHashi Shafi, executive director of the Somali Action Alliance, a Minneapolis-based community organization in the northern U.S. state of Minnesota, says the campaign that led Somalis to shine in U.S. politics started right after 9/11 with a community-based voter registration program.\\n\\n\\n“In the beginning, Somalis were thinking about returning back to Somalia. They had their luggage ready; the artists were singing with songs giving the community a hope of immediate returning, but after 9/11, the community activists realized that such a dream was not realistic, and the Somalis needed to find a way to melt into the pot. Then, we started registering community members to encourage them to vote,” Shafi said. “Somali Americans’ rise in political power has come with its difficulties.”\\n\\n\\nTight-knit community\\n\\n\\nAbdirahman Sharif, the imam and the leader of the Dar-Al-Hijrah Mosque in Minneapolis says another reason Somalis have risen in U.S. politics is because they are a tight-knit community.\\n\\n\\n“When Somalis came to [the] U.S., they moved to a foreign country where they could not communicate with people. So, for them, being close to people from their country meant having someone to communicate with and that helped them to unite their votes, and resources for political aspirants,” Sharif said.\\n\\n\\nThe state of Minnesota has the largest Somali community in the country, mostly in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area. According to U.N. estimates from 2015, there are about 150,000 Somalis, both refugees and nonrefugees, living in the U.S.\\n\\n\\nThe first wave of Somalis came to Minnesota in early 1990s after civil war broke out in their country. Another wave of refugees followed, and the community thrived, thanks to the state's welcoming social programs. It's the biggest Somali community in North America, possibly in the world outside of East Africa.\\n\\n\\nSimilarly, job opportunities and a relatively low cost of living have drawn Somali immigrants to Columbus, Ohio. Ohio has the second largest Somali population in the United States, with an estimated 45,000 immigrants.\\n\\n\\nCommunities have grown significantly in both states. Somali-owned restaurants, mosques, clothing stores, coffee shops and other businesses have opened in several neighborhoods in Minneapolis, called Little Mogadishu, named after Somalia's capital.\\n\\n\\nLarge communities of Somalis are also concentrated in Lewiston and Portland, Maine, as well as Seattle in Washington state, and the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area.\\n\\n\\nAnalyst Abdi-Qafar Abdi Wardere says such concentrations have helped Somalis to gather their strength as a community.\\n\\n\\n“Somalis are bound together by intimate social or cultural ties that helped them to live together and concentrate [in] certain states or neighborhoods in the diaspora. About one-third of Minnesota's Somali residents came directly from refugee camps; others settled first in another state and then relocated to Minnesota. I can say they are somehow a tight-knit community,” Wardere said.\\n\\n\\nCanada and Europe\\n\\n\\nIt’s not only in the United States but Somali immigrants have also found their place in Canadian and European politics. They have gathered in big numbers in major cities to have an impact and exert influence.\\n\\n\\nIn Toronto, Canada, Somalis have made breakthroughs by winning elections and political offices. Ahmed Hussen, a lawyer and community activist born and raised in Somalia, is among the most influential Somalis in Canada. He was first elected as a member of parliament in 2015 to represent York South - Weston. He has previously served as minister of families, children and social development, and minister of immigration, refugees and citizenship. Now he is Canada’s minister of housing, diversity and inclusion.\\n\\n\\nFaisal Ahmed Hassan, who is a Somali Canadian politician, was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 2018 until his defeat in 2022. He thinks for Somalis in the diaspora, there are two reasons they run for political office.\\n\\n\\n“One reason is that the community wants someone to represent their new homes and second is that Somalis inspire one another to doing something. If one of them does something good, others are encouraged that they can do the same,” Hassan said.\\n\\n\\nIn the Nordic region of Europe, the first Somalis arrived in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Later, as Somalia's civil war became more intense, new arrivals joined.\\n\\n\\nIn recent years, the first generation of Somali refugees has been making its mark in politics, from the local council level to the national stage.\\n\\n\\nIn Finland, Suldaan Said Ahmed has been the first Somali-born member of the Finnish parliament since 2021 and he is also the country’s special representative on peace mediation in the Horn of Africa, the northeastern region, where Somalia is located.\\n\\n\\nIn Sweden, Leila Ali Elmi, a former Somali refugee, made history in 2018 becoming the first Somali-Swedish Muslim woman elected to the Swedish parliament.\\n\\n\\nLast year, Marian Abdi Hussein became the first Somali MP in Norway’s history.\\n\\n\\nBoth women also became the first Muslims to wear hijabs in their respect houses of parliament.\\n\\n\\nIn Britain, Magid Magid, a Somali-British activist and politician who served as the mayor of Sheffield from May 2018 to May 2019, became the first Somali elected to the European Parliament.\\n\\n\\nMohamed Gure, a former member of the council of the city of Borlänge, Sweden, said there are unique things that keep Somalis together and make them successful in the politics in Europe.\\n\\n\\n“The fabric of Somalis is unique compared to the other diaspora communities. They share the same ethnicity, color, language, and religion. There are many things that keep them together that divide them back home. So, their togetherness is one reason I can attribute to their successes,” Gure said.\\n\\n\\nGure says the fear of migrants and refugees stoked by politicians has been setting a defining narrative for elections in the West.\\n\\n\\n“One other reason is the fear of a growing number of migrants and refugees in the West. As they are trying to melt into the pot, such fear created by nationalist politicians continues to set a tone for electoral victories that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago,” Gure said.\",\n",

       "  'summary': \"Judith Samkoff needed a bigger dinner table for Thanksgiving this year.\\n\\n\\nThe 65-year-old Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, resident helped resettle an Afghan refugee family of eight, and because this is their first holiday in the United States, Samkoff invited them to her father and sister's home for Thanksgiving.\\n\\n\\n“Because they have a larger dining room table and more dining chairs than I have,” she said, adding, “Our meal is not completely traditional in that we're vegetarians.”\\n\\n\\nIn different homes around the U.S., Jewish volunteers who helped resettle Afghans are welcoming them for their first Thanksgiving dinner on U.S. soil.\\n\\n\\nOne of Samkoff's guests is Hadia, a 24-year-old Afghan refugee whose family fled Afghanistan in November 2021.\\n\\n\\n“We got a call and they said we had to go to the airport right away,” Hadia said of her family’s escape from Kabul. Because of security and safety concerns, VOA is sharing only her first name.\\n\\n\\nIn Afghanistan, Hadia had a bachelor's degree in public administration from Balkh Province. She also volunteered to help displaced people from other countries.\\n\\n\\nWhen Kabul fell to the Taliban, her family had to quickly make plans.\\n\\n\\nThe U.S. completed its withdrawal in August 2021 and helped evacuate more than 130,000 Afghans in a chaotic few weeks after nearly 20 years of war.\\n\\n\\n“We decided to leave our country because my father had a military background,” she said.\\n\\n\\nHadia’s father served in the Afghan army and worked directly with U.S. forces.\\n\\n\\nShe did not disclose who helped her family leave Afghanistan, but they were part of a group of people who were able to go to Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates.\\n\\n\\nThey lived there for four months before receiving authorization to travel to the United States in March 2022.\\n\\n\\nPennsylvania was the place the U.S. government chose for the family to rebuild their lives.\\n\\n\\n“We [didn’t] know anyone here. We [were] worr[ied],” she said, adding, “It's really hard when we [first arrived] … how can we manage, you know, it's really hard to start from zero. You left everything behind in your country. When you come here you must start from zero.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThat is where Samkoff and the other volunteers come in. They help recently arrived Afghans like Hadia and her family settle in and give them the resources they need to be successful in their new homeland.\\n\\n\\nSamkoff said she became a volunteer after talking to a friend who was helping to resettle another Afghan family.\\n\\n\\n“And I said, ‘You know, sign me up. How do we do this?’” Samkoff told VOA.\\n\\n\\nGoodwill\\n\\n\\nSamkoff is one of 1,866 volunteers in the Jewish Federations of North America network, which in partnership with the Shapiro Foundation launched a $1 million refugee resettlement initiative to support local communities around the country, including the Jewish Family Service of Greater Harrisburg (JFS).\\n\\n\\nThe network has resettled 1,963 Afghans across the country and is prepared to resettle more as they arrive.\\n\\n\\nDarcy Hirsh, associate vice president public affairs at Jewish Federations of North America, said volunteers play an important role in helping refugee families resettle.\\n\\n\\n“A lot of it is really goodwill. … Our model allows each community to respond in a way that makes the most sense to them. … I've been really proud of [the] engagement we've seen in communities,” Hirsh said.\\n\\n\\nHirsh said volunteers help find apartments and homes for Afghans. They also work together to furnish the new place, help them enroll children in school, find transportation to job interviews and teach them English.\\n\\n\\n“The support services we have at the agencies will help any Afghan that walks through the doors, but we're working very closely in coalition with many of the resettlement agencies … to pass the Afghan Adjustment Act that would not only help adjust status but provide an easier pathway for those that are remaining in Afghanistan,” she said.\\n\\n\\nThe Afghan Adjustment Act is bipartisan legislation that would allow eligible Afghans to apply for lawful permanent residence in the United States. It was introduced in both chambers of Congress in August.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“So we're hoping that bill will be attached to legislation that passes Congress by December,” Hirsh said.\\n\\n\\n\\nFirst Thanksgiving\\n\\n\\nAt the table, the family and friends had Tofurky, a plant-based, meat substitute made from tofu.\\n\\n\\nHadia said she tried to explain to her mother what the national holiday day means to the United States.\\n\\n\\n“It's like they meet [and] appreciate people with thanks. ... So it's really good. In our culture [it’s] also like that. We don't have any specific date to say thanks but we say thanks [to] everyone,” she said.\\n\\n\\nHadia said she looks forward to the future and hopes to one day work as a diplomat helping other refugees to find safety as she has. In Harrisburg, she is working as a social service worker and is volunteering to assist other refugee families.\\n\\n\\nShe told VOA her family is still adjusting to the new country.\\n\\n\\n“The United States is very busy. … Everyone is busy here. … [But] we have lots of opportunities here. During the morning I can work and during the evening I can take my classes,” she said.\\n\\n\\nSamkoff said helping Hadia’s family is a blessing and makes her feel “really good.”\\n\\n\\n“I don’t have any grandchildren of my own. I feel like if anybody asks me if I have any grandchildren, I would say, ‘Yes, I have seven. One of them is in Germany. I haven’t met him in person yet, but he’s coming,” Samkoff told VOA. That is Hadia’s brother, who is waiting to resettle in the U.S.\\n\\n\\n“My family is always excited when Judith [Samkoff] invites us [to come over] or other volunteers.

Viswanathan came the day before his interview for an employment visa.\\n\\n\\n\"I came here to pray for my brother\\'s U.K. visa 10 years ago and for my wife\\'s U.S. visa two years ago,\" he said. \"They were both successful. So I have faith.\"\\n\\n\\nThe Sri Lakshmi Visa Ganapathy Temple is a few miles north of the airport in Chennai (formerly Madras), a bustling metropolis on the Coromandel Coast in southeast India -- known for its iconic cuisine, ancient temples and churches, silk saris, classical music, dance and sculptures.\\n\\n\\nThis \"visa temple\" has surged in popularity among U.S. visa seekers over the past decade; they can be found in almost any Indian city with a U.S. consulate. They typically gain a following through word of mouth or social media.\\n\\n\\nA mile away from the Ganesh temple is the Sri Lakshmi Narasimha Navaneetha Krishnan Temple, where an idol of Hanuman – a deity who has a human body and the face of a monkey — is believed to possess the power to secure visas. Also known as \"Anjaneya,\" this god stands for strength, wisdom and devotion. In this temple, he has earned the monikers \"America Anjaneya\" and \"Visa Anjaneya.\"\\n\\n\\nThe temple\\'s longtime secretary, G.C. Srinivasan, said it wasn\\'t until 2016 that this temple became a \"visa temple.\"\\n\\n\\n\"It was around that time that a few people who prayed for a visa spread the word around that they were successful, and it\\'s continued,\" he said.\\n\\n\\nA month ago, Srinivasan said he met someone who got news of his visa approval even as as he was circumambulating the Anjaneya idol — a common Hindu practice of walking around a sacred object or site.\\n\\n\\nOn a recent Saturday night, devotees decorated the idol with garlands made of betel leaves. S.

Some also have been elected to city councils, school boards and the boards of parks and recreation in their respective cities. The U.S. midterm elections have proved to be historic for Somalis, with more women elected to public offices than ever before.\\n\\n\\nVOA Somali Service’s Torch Program explains how Somalis who arrived as migrants and refugees to the West have made their way into politics.\\n\\n\\nHashi Shafi, executive director of the Somali Action Alliance, a Minneapolis-based community organization in the northern U.S. state of Minnesota, says the campaign that led Somalis to shine in U.S. politics started right after 9/11 with a community-based voter registration program.\\n\\n\\n“In the beginning, Somalis were thinking about returning back to Somalia. They had their luggage ready; the artists were singing with songs giving the community a hope of immediate returning, but after 9/11, the community activists realized that such a dream was not realistic, and the Somalis needed to find a way to melt into the pot. Then, we started registering community members to encourage them to vote,” Shafi said. “Somali Americans’ rise in political power has come with its difficulties.”\\n\\n\\nTight-knit community\\n\\n\\nAbdirahman Sharif, the imam and the leader of the Dar-Al-Hijrah Mosque in Minneapolis says another reason Somalis have risen in U.S. politics is because they are a tight-knit community.\\n\\n\\n“When Somalis came to [the] U.S., they moved to a foreign country where they could not communicate with people. So, for them, being close to people from their country meant having someone to communicate with and that helped them to unite their votes, and resources for political aspirants,” Sharif said.\\n\\n\\nThe state of Minnesota has the largest Somali community in the country, mostly in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area. According to U.N. estimates from 2015, there are about 150,000 Somalis, both refugees and nonrefugees, living in the U.S.\\n\\n\\nThe first wave of Somalis came to Minnesota in early 1990s after civil war broke out in their country. Another wave of refugees followed, and the community thrived, thanks to the state's welcoming social programs. It's the biggest Somali community in North America, possibly in the world outside of East Africa.\\n\\n\\nSimilarly, job opportunities and a relatively low cost of living have drawn Somali immigrants to Columbus, Ohio. Ohio has the second largest Somali population in the United States, with an estimated 45,000 immigrants.\\n\\n\\nCommunities have grown significantly in both states. Somali-owned restaurants, mosques, clothing stores, coffee shops and other businesses have opened in several neighborhoods in Minneapolis, called Little Mogadishu, named after Somalia's capital.\\n\\n\\nLarge communities of Somalis are also concentrated in Lewiston and Portland, Maine, as well as Seattle in Washington state, and the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area.\\n\\n\\nAnalyst Abdi-Qafar Abdi Wardere says such concentrations have helped Somalis to gather their strength as a community.\\n\\n\\n“Somalis are bound together by intimate social or cultural ties that helped them to live together and concentrate [in] certain states or neighborhoods in the diaspora. About one-third of Minnesota's Somali residents came directly from refugee camps; others settled first in another state and then relocated to Minnesota. I can say they are somehow a tight-knit community,” Wardere said.\\n\\n\\nCanada and Europe\\n\\n\\nIt’s not only in the United States but Somali immigrants have also found their place in Canadian and European politics. They have gathered in big numbers in major cities to have an impact and exert influence.\\n\\n\\nIn Toronto, Canada, Somalis have made breakthroughs by winning elections and political offices. Ahmed Hussen, a lawyer and community activist born and raised in Somalia, is among the most influential Somalis in Canada. He was first elected as a member of parliament in 2015 to represent York South - Weston. He has previously served as minister of families, children and social development, and minister of immigration, refugees and citizenship. Now he is Canada’s minister of housing, diversity and inclusion.\\n\\n\\nFaisal Ahmed Hassan, who is a Somali Canadian politician, was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 2018 until his defeat in 2022. He thinks for Somalis in the diaspora, there are two reasons they run for political office.\\n\\n\\n“One reason is that the community wants someone to represent their new homes and second is that Somalis inspire one another to doing something. If one of them does something good, others are encouraged that they can do the same,” Hassan said.\\n\\n\\nIn the Nordic region of Europe, the first Somalis arrived in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Later, as Somalia's civil war became more intense, new arrivals joined.\\n\\n\\nIn recent years, the first generation of Somali refugees has been making its mark in politics, from the local council level to the national stage.\\n\\n\\nIn Finland, Suldaan Said Ahmed has been the first Somali-born member of the Finnish parliament since 2021 and he is also the country’s special representative on peace mediation in the Horn of Africa, the northeastern region, where Somalia is located.\\n\\n\\nIn Sweden, Leila Ali Elmi, a former Somali refugee, made history in 2018 becoming the first Somali-Swedish Muslim woman elected to the Swedish parliament.\\n\\n\\nLast year, Marian Abdi Hussein became the first Somali MP in Norway’s history.\\n\\n\\nBoth women also became the first Muslims to wear hijabs in their respect houses of parliament.\\n\\n\\nIn Britain, Magid Magid, a Somali-British activist and politician who served as the mayor of Sheffield from May 2018 to May 2019, became the first Somali elected to the European Parliament.\\n\\n\\nMohamed Gure, a former member of the council of the city of Borlänge, Sweden, said there are unique things that keep Somalis together and make them successful in the politics in Europe.\\n\\n\\n“The fabric of Somalis is unique compared to the other diaspora communities. They share the same ethnicity, color, language, and religion. There are many things that keep them together that divide them back home. So, their togetherness is one reason I can attribute to their successes,” Gure said.\\n\\n\\nGure says the fear of migrants and refugees stoked by politicians has been setting a defining narrative for elections in the West.\\n\\n\\n“One other reason is the fear of a growing number of migrants and refugees in the West. As they are trying to melt into the pot, such fear created by nationalist politicians continues to set a tone for electoral victories that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago,” Gure said.\", 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://www.voanews.com/api/zgvmqye_o_qv', 'value': \"From refugees to elected office, 14 Somali Americans have won legislative seats across the U.S. this year.

It was introduced in both chambers of Congress in August.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“So we're hoping that bill will be attached to legislation that passes Congress by December,” Hirsh said.\\n\\n\\n\\nFirst Thanksgiving\\n\\n\\nAt the table, the family and friends had Tofurky, a plant-based, meat substitute made from tofu.\\n\\n\\nHadia said she tried to explain to her mother what the national holiday day means to the United States.\\n\\n\\n“It's like they meet [and] appreciate people with thanks. ... So it's really good. In our culture [it’s] also like that. We don't have any specific date to say thanks but we say thanks [to] everyone,” she said.\\n\\n\\nHadia said she looks forward to the future and hopes to one day work as a diplomat helping other refugees to find safety as she has. In Harrisburg, she is working as a social service worker and is volunteering to assist other refugee families.\\n\\n\\nShe told VOA her family is still adjusting to the new country.\\n\\n\\n“The United States is very busy. … Everyone is busy here. … [But] we have lots of opportunities here. During the morning I can work and during the evening I can take my classes,” she said.\\n\\n\\nSamkoff said helping Hadia’s family is a blessing and makes her feel “really good.”\\n\\n\\n“I don’t have any grandchildren of my own. I feel like if anybody asks me if I have any grandchildren, I would say, ‘Yes, I have seven. One of them is in Germany. I haven’t met him in person yet, but he’s coming,” Samkoff told VOA. That is Hadia’s brother, who is waiting to resettle in the U.S.\\n\\n\\n“My family is always excited when Judith [Samkoff] invites us [to come over] or other volunteers. You know, when we came here, we didn't have any family. Now they’re my family. I call Judith my grandmother,” Hadia said.\"}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://www.voanews.com/a/in-pennsylvania-afghan-refugees-celebrate-first-thanksgiving/6848961.html'}, {'length': '0', 'type': 'image/png', 'href': 'https://gdb.voanews.com/03370000-0aff-0242-72d4-08dace63898c_cx0_cy16_cw0_w800_h450.png', 'rel': 'enclosure'}], 'link': 'https://www.voanews.com/a/in-pennsylvania-afghan-refugees-celebrate-first-thanksgiving/6848961.html', 'id': 'https://www.voanews.com/a/in-pennsylvania-afghan-refugees-celebrate-first-thanksgiving/6848961.html', 'guidislink': False, 'published': 'Thu, 24 Nov 2022 15:21:11 -0500', 'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2022, tm_mon=11, tm_mday=24, tm_hour=20, tm_min=21, tm_sec=11, tm_wday=3, tm_yday=328, tm_isdst=0), 'tags': [{'term': 'Immigration', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'USA', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'South & Central Asia', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}], 'authors': [{'name': 'Aline Barros', 'email': 'webdesk@voanews.com'}], 'author': 'webdesk@voanews.com (Aline Barros)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Aline Barros', 'email': 'webdesk@voanews.com'}}\n",

    "displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript. While the main content of the web pages are in the form of HTML, CSS add styling to the pages to make them look nicer and JavaScript files add interactivity to them.\n",

Is it part of a table?), structure a document into logical sections (Does it have a header? Three columns of content? A navigation menu?), and embed content such as images and videos into a page. In this section we will introduce the first two of these, together with the fundamental concepts and syntax you need to know to understand HTML.\n",

    "\n",
    "As already mentioned, HTML is a markup language that tells web browsers how to structure the web pages you visit. It can be as complicated or as simple as the web developer wants it to be. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of content to make it appear or act in a certain way. The enclosing tags can make content into a hyperlink to connect to another page, italicize words, and so on. For example, consider the following line of text:\n",

    "Individual HTML elements aren't very useful on their own. Next, let's examine how individual elements combine to form an entire HTML page:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "<!DOCTYPE html>\n",
    "<html lang=\"en-US\">\n",
    "  <head>\n",
    "    <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n",
    "    <title>My test page</title>\n",
    "  </head>\n",
    "  <body>\n",
    "    <p>This is my page</p>\n",
    "  </body>\n",
    "</html>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `<!DOCTYPE html>`: The doctype. When HTML was young (1991-1992), doctypes were meant to act as links to a set of rules that the HTML page had to follow to be considered good HTML. More recently, the doctype is a historical artifact that needs to be included for everything else to work right. `<!DOCTYPE html>` is the shortest string of characters that counts as a valid doctype. That is all you need to know!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `<html></html>`: The `<html>` element. This element wraps all the content on the page. It is sometimes known as the root element.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `<head></head>`: The `<head>` element. This element acts as a container for everything you want to include on the HTML page, **that isn't the content** the page will show to viewers. This includes keywords and a page description that would appear in search results, CSS to style content, character set declarations, and more. You will learn more about this in the next article of the series.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `<meta charset=\"utf-8\">`: The `<meta>` element. This element represents metadata that cannot be represented by other HTML meta-related elements, like `<base>`, `<link>`, `<script>`, `<style>` or `<title>`. The charset attributes sets the character set for your document to UTF-8, which includes most characters from the vast majority of human written languages. With this setting, the page can now handle any textual content it might contain. There is no reason not to set this, and it can help avoid some problems later.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `<title></title>`: The `<title>` element. This sets the title of the page, which is the title that appears in the browser tab the page is loaded in. The page title is also used to describe the page when it is bookmarked.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. `<body></body>`: The `<body>` element. This contains all the content that displays on the page, including text, images, videos, games, playable audio tracks, or whatever else.\n",

       "'Yonder sky that has wept tears of compassion upon my people for centuries untold, and which to us appears changeless and eternal, may change. Today is fair. Tomorrow it may be overcast with clouds. My words are like the stars that never change. Whatever Seattle says, the great chief at Washington can rely upon with as much certainty as he can upon the return of the sun or the seasons. The white chief says that Big Chief at Washington sends us greetings of friendship and goodwill. This is kind of him for we know he has little need of our friendship in return. His people are many. They are like the grass that covers vast prairies. My people are few. They resemble the scattering trees of a storm-swept plain. The great, and I presume — good, White Chief sends us word that he wishes to buy our land but is willing to allow us enough to live comfortably. This indeed appears just, even generous, for the Red Man no longer has rights that he need respect, and the offer may be wise, also, as we are no longer in need of an extensive country.\\nThere was a time when our people covered the land as the waves of a wind-ruffled sea cover its shell-paved floor, but that time long since passed away with the greatness of tribes that are now but a mournful memory. I will not dwell on, nor mourn over, our untimely decay, nor reproach my paleface brothers with hastening it, as we too may have been somewhat to blame.\\nYouth is impulsive. When our young men grow angry at some real or imaginary wrong, and disfigure their faces with black paint, it denotes that their hearts are black, and that they are often cruel and relentless, and our old men and old women are unable to restrain them. Thus it has ever been. Thus it was when the white man began to push our forefathers ever westward. But let us hope that the hostilities between us may never return. We would have everything to lose and nothing to gain. Revenge by young men is considered gain, even at the cost of their own lives, but old men who stay at home in times of war, and mothers who have sons to lose, know better.\\nOur good father in Washington–for I presume he is now our father as well as yours, since King George has moved his boundaries further north–our great and good father, I say, sends us word that if we do as he desires he will protect us. His brave warriors will be to us a bristling wall of strength, and his wonderful ships of war will fill our harbors, so that our ancient enemies far to the northward — the Haidas and Tsimshians — will cease to frighten our women, children, and old men. Then in reality he will be our father and we his children. But can that ever be? Your God is not our God! Your God loves your people and hates mine! He folds his strong protecting arms lovingly about the paleface and leads him by the hand as a father leads an infant son. But, He has forsaken His Red children, if they really are His. Our God, the Great Spirit, seems also to have forsaken us. Your God makes your people wax stronger every day. Soon they will fill all the land. Our people are ebbing away like a rapidly receding tide that will never return. The white man’s God cannot love our people or He would protect them. They seem to be orphans who can look nowhere for help. How then can we be brothers? How can your God become our God and renew our prosperity and awaken in us dreams of returning greatness? If we have a common Heavenly Father He must be partial, for He came to His paleface children. We never saw Him. He gave you laws but had no word for His red children whose teeming multitudes once filled this vast continent as stars fill the firmament. No; we are two distinct races with separate origins and separate destinies. There is little in common between us.\\nTo us the ashes of our ancestors are sacred and their resting place is hallowed ground. You wander far from the graves of your ancestors and seemingly without regret. Your religion was written upon tablets of stone by the iron finger of your God so that you could not forget. The Red Man could never comprehend or remember it. Our religion is the traditions of our ancestors — the dreams of our old men, given them in solemn hours of the night by the Great Spirit; and the visions of our sachems, and is written in the hearts of our people.\\nYour dead cease to love you and the land of their nativity as soon as they pass the portals of the tomb and wander away beyond the stars. They are soon forgotten and never return. Our dead never forget this beautiful world that gave them being. They still love its verdant valleys, its murmuring rivers, its magnificent mountains, sequestered vales and verdant lined lakes and bays, and ever yearn in tender fond affection over the lonely hearted living, and often return from the happy hunting ground to visit, guide, console, and comfort them.\\nDay and night cannot dwell together. The Red Man has ever fled the approach of the White Man, as the morning mist flees before the morning sun. However, your proposition seems fair and I think that my people will accept it and will retire to the reservation you offer them. Then we will dwell apart in peace, for the words of the Great White Chief seem to be the words of nature speaking to my people out of dense darkness.\\nIt matters little where we pass the remnant of our days. They will not be many. The Indian’s night promises to be dark. Not a single star of hope hovers above his horizon. Sad-voiced winds moan in the distance. Grim fate seems to be on the Red Man’s trail, and wherever he will hear the approaching footsteps of his fell destroyer and prepare stolidly to meet his doom, as does the wounded doe that hears the approaching footsteps of the hunter.\\nA few more moons, a few more winters, and not one of the descendants of the mighty hosts that once moved over this broad land or lived in happy homes, protected by the Great Spirit, will remain to mourn over the graves of a people once more powerful and hopeful than yours. But why should I mourn at the untimely fate of my people? Tribe follows tribe, and nation follows nation, like the waves of the sea. It is the order of nature, and regret is useless. Your time of decay may be distant, but it will surely come, for even the White Man whose God walked and talked with him as friend to friend, cannot be exempt from the common destiny. We may be brothers after all. We will see.\\nWe will ponder your proposition and when we decide we will let you know. But should we accept it, I here and now make this condition that we will not be denied the privilege without molestation of visiting at any time the tombs of our ancestors, friends, and children. Every part of this soil is sacred in the estimation of my people. Every hillside, every valley, every plain and grove, has been hallowed by some sad or happy event in days long vanished. Even the rocks, which seem to be dumb and dead as the swelter in the sun along the silent shore, thrill with memories of stirring events connected with the lives of my people, and the very dust upon which you now stand responds more lovingly to their footsteps than yours, because it is rich with the blood of our ancestors, and our bare feet are conscious of the sympathetic touch. Our departed braves, fond mothers, glad, happy hearted maidens, and even the little children who lived here and rejoiced here for a brief season, will love these somber solitudes and at eventide they greet shadowy returning spirits. And when the last Red Man shall have perished, and the memory of my tribe shall have become a myth among the White Men, these shores will swarm with the invisible dead of my tribe, and when your children’s children think themselves alone in the field, the store, the shop, upon the highway, or in the silence of the pathless woods, they will not be alone. In all the earth there is no place dedicated to solitude. At night when the streets of your cities and villages are silent and you think them deserted, they will throng with the returning hosts that once filled them and still love this beautiful land. The White Man will never be alone.\\nLet him be just and deal kindly with my people, for the dead are not powerless. Dead, did I say? There is no death, only a change of worlds.\\n'"

    "\n",
    "In this section, we will show you how to use Selenium (a browser automation software) with python, to collect data from websites that only load content once you interact with (scrolling, clicking, etc.), and are difficult to obtain through more traditional scraping approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dynamic websites\n",
    "Dynamic websites change their content (i.e., source code) due to various reasons, such as:\n",
    "   - Clicking, scrolling, mouse hovering \n",
    "   - Screen sizes, languages (IP-based), devices, time of the day\n",
    "   - Previous visits (user’s browsing history)\n",
    "   - And more!\n",
    "\n",
    "Changes can occur on the client side, such as JavaScript interactions, that do not necessarily change the source code from the websites but change its appearance, such as expanding text boxes. In that case, classical scraping methods are sufficient for grabbing the entire text because the displayed truncated version of a text might already be entirely stored in the source code. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, changes can also occur on the server side, leading to changes in the website’s appearance and content (i.e., source code). For example, scrolling to the bottom of a website leads to more content being loaded. Such effects can often be observed in social media feeds (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Quora) or online shopping platforms, enabling users to scroll endlessly. Website interactions that lead to content changes are often challenging or not obtainable through classical scraping approaches since they require a JavaScript execution initiated by user interaction. Interestingly, we can use browser automation tools, such as Selenium, to help us imitate user interactions and make data collection possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Getting started\n",
    "\n",
    "The Selenium webpage contains documentation for all the programming languages, which you can find [here](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/). However, the documentation is not as concise, and since we are using python, we can also find a separate documentation [here](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Both documentations are very handy and should be kept close when working with Selenium. When you inspect the documentation, you will recognize that besides sending specific behavioral commands to the browser, accessing web elements is very similar to other approaches, such as beautiful soup. You will need XPATH, CSS selectors, and other properties of web elements to interact with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we will showcase how you can use Selenium with Chrome to collect data from the dynamic website Quora. Before collecting data, we need to check whether we are allowed to collect data from the website. Quora states that we are permitted to employ scrapers but must adhere to the [robots.txt](https://www.quora.com/robots.txt), which specifies the allowed and disallowed contents for scraping, and that we make us known to the website so that they can contact us if they want to. We can give Quora our contact information by adding them to the user-agent, the information the browser sends to the website. *Section 4-d: Permitted uses of Quora’s terms of service* specifies the rules for scraping (see the screenshot below):\n",

    "Web scraping provides us the daily data we need for analysis and decision making. While different types of task sizes and websites are available to obtain data from, the various libraries that we teach here can make our tasks easier and faster. We have talked about BeautifulSoup and Selenium, which show us that BeautifulSoup is more user-friendly and allows us to learn faster and begin web scraping smaller tasks in an efficient way. Whereas in Selenium, tasks are more complicated and the target website has a lot of java elements in its code. We can use Selenium to control every major web browser such as chrome, internet explorer, and Firefox. Our actions aren’t limited to loading web pages, we can also perform other actions that allow us better interact with the websites such as mouse clicks and filling forms. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have not introduced [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/) yet as it is more for complex web tasks. It uses less memory and CPU storage and supports data extraction from HTML sources as well. We can even extend its functionality. As we mentioned, it is great a great library for complex and larger projects and we can easily transfer existing projects into another project.\n",
    "\n",
    "In all, we should have good knowledge of all the tools available so that we can choose the best tool depending on our tasks. As we have seen, we can comfortably use any of the libraries as they are all free and also open source. Having a community of developers to support us is a big plus as we develop our projects and use the libraries. The choice of one over the other however depends on the project we have at hand.
