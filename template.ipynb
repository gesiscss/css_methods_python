    "# Template for a new session\n",
    "\n",
    "Existing training materials on Computational Social Science (CSS) are either online code tutorials that are, however, devoid of social scientific lessons worthy of being graded. Or they are textbook-like introductions to methods with a social science perspective where the code part, however, is detached from, and found in another place than, the lessons. The sessions in this course, on the other hand, are fully integrated, which means, social scientific lessons are taught by exemplifying and explaining methods in computer code while making the connection to methodology and theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sessions in this course are supposed to be similar in style, length, and teaching content. This **template** is a guide how to achieve that. Regarding the length and density of teching lessons, please study the sessions that already exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Rules](https://www.uni-giessen.de/de/studium/lehre/plagiate/plagiarism3) apply as in all academic writing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "A notebook has an introduction, at least two sections (numbered .1, .2, etc.), and a list of references. Large sections can have at least two numbered subsections. Numbered subsubsections are not used.\n",
    "\n",
    "The introduction introduces and defines the high-level concepts used throughout the notebook. These concepts spell out the overall topic of a notebook, are basic to the session's learning objectives, and tend to belong to methodological (as opposed to implementation/coding) aspects. When a high-level concept is defined, the concept name is formatted **bold**. *Italic* formatting is used for latin words and abbreviations such as *e.g.*, *.i.e.*, or *vice versa*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Low-level concepts are introduced in the sections. These concepts give depth to the overall topic, either methodologically or in terms of implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abbreviations (*e.g.*, ML for Machine Learning) can be used but should be limited to the most important few.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### References\n",
    "\n",
    "We do not reinvent textbooks and other teaching resources here but make references to them. This is what sets these sessions apart from other teaching materials: coding tutorials are embedded in the corresponding research literature, making the connection between data, computing, and theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main textbook used in the course is McLevey's (<a href='#mclevey_doing_2022'>2022</a>) *Doing Computational Social Science: A Practical Introduction*, a rather complete introduction to methods in the field with well-structured and insightful chapters. The network preprocessing and analysis sessions benefit from Platt's (<a href='#platt_network_2019'>2019</a>) *Network Science with Python and NetworkX Quick Start Guide* and Menczer *et al.*'s (<a href='#menczer_a_2020'>2020</a>) *A First Course in Network Science*. In sessions on data science, statistical modeling, and machine learning methods, chapters from the *Handbook of Computational Social Science*, volume 2, by Engel *et al.* (<a href='#engel_handbook_2022'>2022</a>) give depth. To limit the number of books that students of this course are recommended to study, we try to not introduce other textbooks unless necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Above examples show how references made in a paragraph are linked to the list of references at the end of the notebook. APA citation style is used. These are citations of a paper (<a href='#sapiezynski_interaction_2019'>Sapiezynski *et al.*, 2019</a>) and a book chapter or proceedings article (<a href='#dimitrov_tweetscov19_2020'>Dimitrov *et al.*, 2020</a>), respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Links\n",
    "\n",
    "The main use of links in the text is to give depth to a paragraph or concept. The linked website should be informative and stable. We have frequently used Wikipedia in these sessions. This is a link to the [computational social science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_social_science) Wikipedia page. If it is necessary to link to a blog post or an article in an online magazine, use a reference instead. In general, the reference list should contain scholarly work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sessions should be connected to each other, either by continuing a workflow or by using the same dataset. Link to other sessions to make connections clear. This is a link to [Session D1: Micro-level network analysis and community detection](1_micro_level_network_analysis_and_community_detection.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Figures\n",
    "\n",
    "Figures should be stored in a folder named \"images\". Embed a figure like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "|<img src='images/copenhagen.jpg' style='float: none; width: 480px'>|\n",
    "|:--|\n",
    "|<em style='float: center'>**Figure 1**: USE EXAMPLE WITH SOURCE</em>|\n",
    "\n",
    "When referring to a figure in the text, make the first reference bold and italic. This is the first reference to ***figure 1***. In all subsequent references, just make it italic. This is the second reference to *figure 1*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure to have the right to reproduce a figure. Check the license of an image or produce it yourself. If necessary, give a source as in *figure 1*.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data\n",
    "\n",
    "To make for a coherent learning experience across different sessions, we try to limit the course to a few datasets. These are a corpus of tweets on the topic of COVID from May 2020 (<a href='#dimitrov_tweetscov19_2020'>Dimitrov *et al.*, 2020</a>), social networks from the Copenhagen Networks Study (<a href='#sapiezynski_interaction_2019'>Sapiezynski *et al.*, 2019</a>), and the Varieties of Democracy dataset on countries and principles of democracy (). Other datasets may be introduced, though.\n",

    "\n",
    "Put a summary of the session here. All concepts used here must already be introduced above. Report what the subsessions are dedicated to or what students will learn in a concise manner, like in an abstract. For example: Subsession **X.1** revolves around ...

    "When teaching a method, it may be useful to use a simple toy dataset where results are fully controlled and easy to interpret.

    "\n",
    "To ensure a problem-free session experience, make sure to develop all computer code for the Python package versions defined in the [environment](binder/environment.yml) file. Try not to add packages to the list because more packages mean more potential package conflicts. Nevertheless, there can be good reasons to add new packages. In general, you should be in contact with us editors before you start developing a new session for this course. Certainly, also contact us if you plan to use a new package.
