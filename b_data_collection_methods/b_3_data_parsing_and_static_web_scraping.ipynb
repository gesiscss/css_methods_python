    "\n",
    "**Data collection** is a procedure of gathering information from subjects (all relevant sources), measuring and analyzing insights for research using various techniques, such as web scraping or API harvesting. Researchers can evaluate their research questions and hypotheses on the basis of collected data. In most cases, data collection is the primary and most important step for research, irrespective of the field of study. The approach of data collection varies for different fields of study, depending on the required information.\n",

    "Digital behavioral data from the internet is an absolutely massive source of data which we can access by various ways such as connecting APIs (see [Session 3: API harvesting](https://github.com/gesiscss/css_methods_python/blob/main/b_data_collection_methods/3_api_harvesting.ipynb)). In addition to APIs, web scraping opens up another way to access **Digital Behavioral Data** that it is not available in convenient CSV exports or APIs. Also, APIs are not offered by every websites, and they might not always provide every piece of information we need. Therefore, scraping can be the only solution to extract data from websites. \n",
    "\n",
    "Websites are often valuable sources of data; for example, [weather forecasts](https://www.accuweather.com/), [articles on news sites](https://www.washingtonpost.com/), and [posts on forums](https://quora.com/). To access these sorts of information on webpages, we can use web scraping. Different use cases are studied after collecting data by web scarping to understand hospitality through online reviews, compare food prices,  aggregate news and bank accounts, and build datasets which are not available otherwise (Han et al., 2021; Hillen 2019)..\n",
    "\n",
    "While web scraping is one of the common ways of collecting data from websites, a lot of websites offer APIs to access the public data that they host on their website. This is to avoid unnecessary traffic on the websites. However, even though we have access to these API, as researchers, we should not forget to respect API access rules and always read the **Terms of Use** documents before collecting data. In order to access APIs, you first need to create an account and apply to have a developer account on the platform that you want to work on. With this developer account, platforms provide you KEYS (e.g., secret, public, or access) to authenticate their system. The more practical information and hands on examples on API harvesting can be found in [Session 3: API harvesting](https://github.com/gesiscss/css_methods_python/blob/main/b_data_collection_methods/3_api_harvesting.ipynb).\n",

    "you will learn how to do web scraping with Python from scratch. In subsession **4.1**, we will have a deep look at the fundamentals of web scraping. You will experience how you can use the Python libraries to handle different data collections. In subsubsession **4.1.1**, you will learn about basics for the feed parsing with the feedparser library, and in subsubsession **4.1.2**, you will learn about html syntax. We move to the basic web scraping tool; the Beautiful soup library in the following subsession **4.2**. In subsession **4.3**, we will introduce the Selenium library to collect data from dynamic websites that only load content once you interact with it (scrolling, clicking, etc.) and are difficult to obtain through more traditional scraping approaches. We will work through an actual web scraping projects throughout this session, focusing on online news sites, pdf pages, and Quora. Finally, in subsession **4.4**, we will compare these libraries and talk about the challanges and data privacy approaches.\n",

Content distributors syndicate a web feed, thereby allowing users to subscribe a channel to it by adding the feed resource address to a news aggregator client (also called a feed reader or a news reader). Users typically subscribe to a feed by manually entering the URL of a feed or clicking a link in a web browser or by dragging the link from the web browser to the aggregator, thus \"RSS and Atom files provide news updates from a website in a simple form for your computer.\"\n",

Is it part of a table?), structure a document into logical sections (Does it have a header? Three columns of content? A navigation menu?), and embed content such as images and videos into a page.

    "As already mentioned, HTML is a markup language that tells web browsers how to structure the web pages you visit. It can be as complicated or as simple as the web developer wants it to be. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of content to make it appear or act in a certain way.

    "  </body>\n",
    "</html>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `<!DOCTYPE html>`: The doctype. When HTML was young (1991-1992), doctypes were meant to act as links to a set of rules that the HTML page had to follow to be considered good HTML. More recently, the doctype is a historical artifact that needs to be included for everything else to work right. `<!DOCTYPE html>` is the shortest string of characters that counts as a valid doctype. That is all you need to know!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `<html></html>`: The `<html>` element. This element wraps all the content on the page. It is sometimes known as the root element.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. `<head></head>`: The `<head>` element. This element acts as a container for everything you want to include on the HTML page, **that isn't the content** the page will show to viewers. This includes keywords and a page description that would appear in search results, CSS to style content, character set declarations, and more. You will learn more about this in the next article of the series.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `<meta charset=\"utf-8\">`: The `<meta>` element. This element represents metadata that cannot be represented by other HTML meta-related elements, like `<base>`, `<link>`, `<script>`, `<style>` or `<title>`. The charset attributes sets the character set for your document to UTF-8, which includes most characters from the vast majority of human written languages. With this setting, the page can now handle any textual content it might contain. There is no reason not to set this, and it can help avoid some problems later.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `<title></title>`: The `<title>` element. This sets the title of the page, which is the title that appears in the browser tab the page is loaded in. The page title is also used to describe the page when it is bookmarked.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. `<body></body>`: The `<body>` element. This contains all the content that displays on the page, including text, images, videos, games, playable audio tracks, or whatever else.\n",

For example, if we want to investigate the news exposure in specific countries and compare the topics of news, the first step will be collecting news articles from news websites. Or, if our project is related to understanding the subjects discussed at the European Union meetings, we first should have those meeting minutes at hand.

Also, after you find the reason to this, if the reason is not technically solvable, can you write a line of code that passes this error and continues downloading the other available pages? Let's also save these PDFs output under the outputs folder. ./outputs/PDFs/...\n",
