    "Data collection is a procedure of gathering information from subjects (all relevant sources), measuring and analyzing accurate insights for research using various techniques. Researchers can evaluate their research questions and hypotheses on the basis of collected data. In most cases, data collection is the primary and most important step for research, irrespective of the field of study. The approach of data collection varies for different fields of study, depending on the required information.\n",

In addtion to APIs, web scraping is often the only way we can access data that it is not available in convenient CSV exports or APIs. Websites are often valuable sources of data; for example, weather forecasts, comments on news sites, and posts on forums. To access those sorts of information on webpages, we use web scraping.\n",

    "you will learn how to do web scraping with Python from scratch. In subsession **4.1**, we will have a deep look at the fundamentals of web scraping. You will experience how you can use the Python libraries to handle different data collections. In subsubsession **4.1.1**, you will learn about basics for the feed parsing with the feedparser library, and in subsubsession **4.1.2**, you will learn about html syntax. We move to the basic web scraping tool; the Beautiful soup library in the following subsession **4.2**. In subsession **4.3**, we will introduce the Selenium library to collect data from websites that only load content once you interact with it (scrolling, clicking, etc.) and are difficult to obtain through more traditional scraping approaches. We will work through an actual web scraping projects throughout this session, focusing on Wikipedia pages, online news sites, pdf pages, and Quora. Finally, in subsession **4.4**, we will compare these libraries and talk about the challanges and data privacy approaches.\n",

Content distributors syndicate a web feed, thereby allowing users to subscribe a channel to it by adding the feed resource address to a news aggregator client (also called a feed reader or a news reader). Users typically subscribe to a feed by manually entering the URL of a feed or clicking a link in a web browser or by dragging the link from the web browser to the aggregator, thus \"RSS and Atom files provide news updates from a website in a simple form for your computer.\"\n",

While the main content of the web pages are in the form of HTML, CSS add styling to the pages to make them look nicer and JavaScript files add interactivity to them.\n",

Is it part of a table?), structure a document into logical sections (Does it have a header? Three columns of content? A navigation menu?), and embed content such as images and videos into a page. In this section we will introduce the first two of these, together with the fundamental concepts and syntax you need to know to understand HTML.\n",

    "\n",
    "As already mentioned, HTML is a markup language that tells web browsers how to structure the web pages you visit. It can be as complicated or as simple as the web developer wants it to be. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of content to make it appear or act in a certain way. The enclosing tags can make content into a hyperlink to connect to another page, italicize words, and so on. For example, consider the following line of text:\n",

    "\n",
    "1. `<!DOCTYPE html>`: The doctype. When HTML was young (1991-1992), doctypes were meant to act as links to a set of rules that the HTML page had to follow to be considered good HTML. More recently, the doctype is a historical artifact that needs to be included for everything else to work right. `<!DOCTYPE html>` is the shortest string of characters that counts as a valid doctype. That is all you need to know!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `<html></html>`: The `<html>` element. This element wraps all the content on the page. It is sometimes known as the root element.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `<head></head>`: The `<head>` element. This element acts as a container for everything you want to include on the HTML page, **that isn't the content** the page will show to viewers. This includes keywords and a page description that would appear in search results, CSS to style content, character set declarations, and more. You will learn more about this in the next article of the series.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `<meta charset=\"utf-8\">`: The `<meta>` element. This element represents metadata that cannot be represented by other HTML meta-related elements, like `<base>`, `<link>`, `<script>`, `<style>` or `<title>`. The charset attributes sets the character set for your document to UTF-8, which includes most characters from the vast majority of human written languages. With this setting, the page can now handle any textual content it might contain. There is no reason not to set this, and it can help avoid some problems later.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `<title></title>`: The `<title>` element. This sets the title of the page, which is the title that appears in the browser tab the page is loaded in. The page title is also used to describe the page when it is bookmarked.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. `<body></body>`: The `<body>` element. This contains all the content that displays on the page, including text, images, videos, games, playable audio tracks, or whatever else.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this section, we will show you how to use Selenium (a browser automation software) with python, to collect data from websites that only load content once you interact with them (scrolling, clicking, etc.), and are difficult to obtain through more traditional scraping approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dynamic websites\n",
    "Dynamic websites change their content (i.e., source code) due to various reasons, such as:\n",
    "   - Clicking, scrolling, mouse hovering \n",
    "   - Screen sizes, languages (IP-based), devices, time of the day\n",
    "   - Previous visits (user’s browsing history)\n",
    "   - And more!\n",
    "\n",
    "Changes can occur on the client side, such as JavaScript interactions, that do not necessarily change the source code from the websites but change its appearance, such as expanding text boxes. In that case, classical scraping methods are sufficient for grabbing the entire text because the displayed truncated version of a text might already be entirely stored in the source code. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, changes can also occur on the server side, leading to changes in the website’s appearance and content (i.e., source code). For example, scrolling to the bottom of a website leads to more content being loaded. Such effects can often be observed in social media feeds (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Quora) or online shopping platforms, enabling users to scroll endlessly. Website interactions that lead to content changes are often challenging or not obtainable through classical scraping approaches since they require a JavaScript execution initiated by user interaction. Interestingly, we can use browser automation tools, such as Selenium, to help us imitate user interactions and make data collection possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting started\n",
    "\n",
    "Selenium is a [browser automation software](https://www.selenium.dev/) that can interface with many different browser types and programming languages. Thus, we can write programming scripts that control the browser and imitate our behavior, such as clicking or scrolling. Before we can start writing a programming script, we need to set up Selenium by downloading a driver. Depending on the browser we want to use (e.g., Firefox, Chrome), we need a different driver, which could be found [here](https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/). In this notebook, we will go through instructions for using both Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox, for which you can find the drivers [here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) and [here](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases), respectively. To download the correct driver, you need to know which operating system (e.g. Windows, Linux, Mac) your machine runs on, and which browser version you have. For Chrome, you can find the browser version under Settings > About Chrome (see screenshot below):\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='images/chrome_version.JPEG' width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" align=\"center\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Download the correct driver, and after unpacking the zip folder, place the *.exe* driver file in the same folder we are running this script.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Selenium webpage contains documentation for all the programming languages, which you can find [here](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/). However, the documentation is not as concise, and since we are using python, we can also find a separate documentation [here](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Both documentations are very handy and should be kept close when working with Selenium. When you inspect the documentation, you will recognize that besides sending specific behavioral commands to the browser, accessing web elements is very similar to other approaches, such as beautiful soup. You will need XPATH, CSS selectors, and other properties of web elements to interact with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we will showcase how you can use Selenium with Chrome/Firefox to collect data from the dynamic website Quora. Before collecting data, we need to check whether we are allowed to collect data from the website. Quora states that we are permitted to employ scrapers but must adhere to the [robots.txt](https://www.quora.com/robots.txt), which specifies the allowed and disallowed contents for scraping, and that we make ourself known to the website so that they can contact us if they want to. We can give Quora our contact information by adding them to the user-agent, the information the browser sends to the website. *Section 4-d: Permitted uses of Quora’s terms of service* specifies the rules for scraping (see the screenshot below):\n",

    "Web scraping provides us the daily data we need for analysis and decision making. While different types of task sizes and websites are available to obtain data from, the various libraries that we teach here can make our tasks easier and faster. We have talked about BeautifulSoup and Selenium, which show us that BeautifulSoup is more user-friendly and allows us to learn faster and begin web scraping smaller tasks in an efficient way. Whereas in Selenium, tasks are more complicated and the target website has a lot of java elements in its code. We can use Selenium to control every major web browser such as chrome, internet explorer, and Firefox. Our actions aren’t limited to loading web pages, we can also perform other actions that allow us better interact with the websites such as mouse clicks and filling forms. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have not introduced [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/) yet as it is more for complex web tasks. It uses less memory and CPU storage and supports data extraction from HTML sources as well. We can even extend its functionality. As we mentioned, it is great a great library for complex and larger projects and we can easily transfer existing projects into another project.\n",
    "\n",
    "In all, we should have good knowledge of all the tools available so that we can choose the best tool depending on our tasks. As we have seen, we can comfortably use any of the libraries as they are all free and also open source. Having a community of developers to support us is a big plus as we develop our projects and use the libraries. The choice of one over the other however depends on the project we have at hand. They all have their pros and cons."
